<message><![CDATA[<p>Hi Zahra, great question and a real concern for many clients. Nausea and fatigue can definitely impact a woman’s ability to make the best choices and eat nutrient-dense foods. I experienced this firsthand with my second pregnancy (without having even the slightest nausea during my first). We will cover how to help women manage both nausea and fatigue in Module 3, along with how to best nutritionally support these conditions. During a consultation, we would also go over the foods that your client is feeling adverse to, see which nutrients they may be lacking due to these aversions, and then help them build a supplement protocol to accommodate for the possible inadequacies in their diet.</p>]]></message>

<message><![CDATA[<p>Some whole food based prenatal vitamins like MegaFood,use yeast to propagate vitamins and minerals. MegaFoods uses s. cervevisiae as a yeast medium. Yeast can be a major problem for a lot of people who are already dealing with overgrowth. It can lead to symptoms that indicate systemic dysbiosis. Do you know of whole food brands that don't contain yeast? For individuals that have known issues with yeast overgrowth, would you recommend a professional brand synthetic prenatal? Any other thoughts on this?  I'll be attending the 11pm call tomorrow. Thank you!</p>]]></message>

<message><![CDATA[<p>Hi there - joining the 11 pm call tomorrow.</p><p>A few questions.</p><p>1. You mention that excess folic acid in the body is problematic - wondering why it is problematic and if there are symptoms as a result of excess? Is there a study you would recommend to get more information on this?</p><p>2. Do you typically recommend MTHFR testing for clients? If so, what determines when you might make a recommendation for this?</p><p>3. How does one determine dietary intake of necessary nutrients? Is there a method you use to determine how much of a certain nutrient clients are getting in order to determine supplementation recommendations? Or is it simply by knowing clients are eating certain foods regularly means they are likely getting enough of a certain nutrient?</p><p>Thank you!</p>]]></message>

<message><![CDATA[<p>Hi! Here are my qns for the Q&amp;A. I will be on the 11pm UTC call:</p><p>1. What’s are your thoughts on Celtic salt vs Himalayan pink salt?</p><p>2. The upper tolerable limit for Vit C is 2000mg. If a pregnant/breastfeeding mother has a cold/the flu, is it possible to take more? Are there any negative effects of going over 2000mg/day?</p><p>3. Our notes say magnesium sulfate (Epsom salt) is not recommended as this form is poorly absorbed and can cause stomach discomfort. So should a pregnant mother (or even non-pregnant people) not take Epsom salt baths?</p><p>4. Our notes say that to replete iodine stores, cooked/fermented cruciferous veg is preferred over raw. Our notes also say that those who follow a plant-based diet should take an iodine supplement. If a plant based eater increases their consumption of cooked/fermented cruciferous veg, do they still have to take the supplement?</p><p>5. Qn about a particular brand of iron: “Floradix Floravital Iron + herbs”. What are your thoughts for a pregnant woman? Can other family members in the house like her husband (he has low iron) and a 4 year old take it?</p><p>6. Qn about a particular brand of b12: “mykind organics b12 organic spray”. What are your thoughts for a pregnant woman? Can other family members in the house like her husband and a 4 year old take it?</p><p>Thanks! Looking forward to hopping on!</p>]]></message>

<message><![CDATA[<p>Hello, I'm going to try and make at least part of the 11pm call. Will plan to listen to the recorded portion of what I miss.</p><p>1. You recommend non-synthetic forms of vitamin C, as they absorb better, however are there negative side effects, beyond lack of absorption, to be aware of with ascorbic acid?</p><p>2. You mention the benefit of DNA synthesis - What would be an example, the risks presented, with poor DNA synthesis?</p><p>3. Many pre-natal vitamins have many other vitamins and ingredients that have not been mentioned thus far in our modules pertaining to nutrition in pregnancy. What would you suggest to someone like me, who is new to the field of nutrition, in resources to educate myself and future clients about ingredients I'm unfamiliar with?</p><p>4. There have been a few times you have mentioned the tandem relationship of some of these vitamins in relation to others. Is this true on a more general and broad scale or just where it is mentioned (choline/folate, calcium/d3/k2)? How interdependent are nutrients, especially as it pertains to nutritional needs in pregnancy?</p><p>I appreciate Emma's questions as well, I had similar thoughts. I look forward to learning!</p>]]></message>

<message><![CDATA[<p>Hi Noam, I do recommend taking a prenatal multivitamin throughout the course of IVF. However, in this case I would ensure that the brand used is sourced exclusively from whole foods, as the excess of these nutrients won't 'build up' in the body. If not taking a prenatal multivitamin the whole time, folate (MTHF) is the bare minimum. The recommendations for IVF are so complex (well beyond what I can convey here) and I hope to have fertility/infertility available as a program through the Academy in the near future! (P.S. so nice to connect with you yesterday!)</p>]]></message>

<message><![CDATA[<p>Hi Emma, does the label only list DV and no other unit of measurement? I don't usually see that! As for DV, this is the 'daily value' as determined by the FDA. "DV = Daily Value. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) developed DVs to help consumers compare the nutrient contents of products within the context of a total diet." We do cover this more in Foundational Nutrition, however, where it gets tricky is that... 1. This is different for pregnancy than it is for non-pregnant adults, so unless the supplement is 'prenatal' specific, the DV won't be appropriate. 2. I personally don't always agree with the FDA recommendations, especially when it comes to pregnancy. If you have a certain label that you'd like my feedback on, feel free to send me a screenshot or a link to the product and I'll help you figure it out :)</p>]]></message>

<message><![CDATA[<p>I'm wondering about the timing of taking prenatal vitamins. I've been told it's best to take it following a meal in order to increase its bioavailability once your digestion is most active. However, I am iron-deficient and know that I shouldn't take iron with calcium because it decreases absorption. Should I avoid taking it after a meal with calcium? Or take it while absorption for most nutrients is highest? Also, I've seen prenatals that recommend taking them on an empty stomach. What is the benefit of this? Thanks!</p>]]></message>

<message><![CDATA[<p>The 'timing' of supplements can be unique to the individual, but generally I recommend with/after a meal. As you mentioned, it does help with absorption. As for iron deficiency, if taking a whole foods/plant-based multi, this might not be enough to replete your iron stores. The amount/type of iron that is in a whole foods/plant-based multi is usually only sufficient to maintain stores in someone who has levels in the normal range. So you may want to consider taking an additional iron bisglycinate, which would be away from calcium rich foods. However, you'd take less of this to account for the iron you're already getting from the multi. Hope that makes sense!</p>]]></message>

<message><![CDATA[<p>Hi Zahra, great question! Module 4 is all about precautions in pregnancy so we dive into this topic deeper then. For now, as with all things in pregnancy we need to help clients weigh the risk vs reward. ACV does have a very (very) small risk of containing pathogenic bacteria. The being said, no food can be guaranteed safe and it is much riskier to consume leafy greens - but no pregnant woman is told to avoid them! ACV does have a very high safety profile. We know that it contain beneficial bacteria and can aid in many conditions. In fact studies show that ACV is in fact anti-pathogen with strong antimicrobial properties, specifically E-coli, and candida. (<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5788933/)" rel="nofollow noopener" title="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5788933/)">https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.go...</a> Therefore, I do consider raw, unpasteurized ACV a safe and effective remedy for pregnancy.</p>]]></message>

<message><![CDATA[<p>Thank you! This is very interesting. It also reinforces the fact that medical protocol is to just provide a list of foods that are not recommended (almost scaring pregnant women with no backup) but there is no recommendation for how to properly nourish mother and baby. Unless a pregnant woman understands the benefits of some of these nutrient rich foods and does her own research she could potentially avoid things like this.</p>]]></message>

<message><![CDATA[<p>Hi Emma, great question. She revealed that she's "on the low end of the normal range" on her health intake form that you received before meeting with her. So the question becomes 'how would you proceed'. There isn't really a wrong way to proceed, it's just an exercise of walking through that process. You could email her and get your (hypothetical) answer to be prepared for the consultation. Or you could just ask her more info when you meet in person. Generally speaking, the blood tests don't reveal which type of deficiency it is unless she was to get additional testing. So you would be basing your recommendations off her symptoms, which are fatigue + a blood test that reveals 'low iron'. Hope that helps!</p>]]></message>

Most smoothies just contain fruit and that's it (that's why I indicated green). I've actually got a guide to balancing smoothies that I'll be sure to share in Foundational Nutrition!</p><p>For evening primrose oil, my thoughts are the same used orally or applied to the cervix. Many midwives still recommend its use, but I am cautious with it.</p><p>Perineum massage is no risk as long as the water have not released. However, to reduce tearing I think it’s way (way, way) more important that women are 1) not coached to push, 2) encouraged to only push when they feel the urge, and 3) not confined to birth on their backs. However, perineum massage might be most helpful if a client knows in advance they want an epidural - as limited feeling will increase risk of tearing. Either may might help/won't hurt.</p><p>“Birth prep" The herb I’m cautious of in there is Pennyroyal as it is known to cause abortions and start menstruation. Therefore it has the potential to ‘start’ labor before the baby/body is ready.  (Was included in Module 4 list of herbs as one to avoid in pregnancy).</p><p>Hope that helps<br>x Carley</p>]]></message>

<message><![CDATA[<p>Thanks for your reply!<br>I wish I could go back in time..my midwife suggested Birth Prep, Primrose oil, perineum massage from 36 w , and acupuncture from 40w...and, at one day into labor, castor oil. Hopefully nothing bad happened and Giuditta was born healthy and at home. But now, after reading module 5 I can say that I would have done things differently!</p>]]></message>

<message><![CDATA[<p>My understanding is that they are generally safe, but to be honest I don't include them in my practice (unless it's something well-known an reliable such as arnica for postpartum). Homeopathic remedies are so vast and I feel that I would have to dedicate my career to studying homeopathy in order to be comfortable consulting on them specifically. I'd be more than happy to refer a client out for this, but I'm actually never asked about them by my clients.</p>]]></message>

<message><![CDATA[<p>Hi Lauren, yes great add! I would recommend the suggestions you provided. Activated charcoal is another great remedy that's safe for pregnancy. A standard dose is 1-2 grams, 3 x/day. Although higher doses are safe too. Charcoal can bind to nutrients as well, so it's best taken away from supplements.</p>]]></message>

<message><![CDATA[<p>Lower bone mineralization is a known concern with premature infants compared to those born at term. There is conflicting data regarding the long-term consequences of preterm birth on skeletal health. Some believe that under-mineralization during such a critical period could increase future risk of childhood fracture and osteoporosis in adulthood. While others think that these infants catch up without future risk. The thing is that there’s not much we can “do” in these cases, other than encouraging mindful nutrition and an active lifestyle through childhood. Bone density requires not only nutrients, but also resistance (weight). I actually know of a study that “exercised” preterm infants (pushed against their limbs lightly) to mimic the resistance they would get in utero and it did result in an increase in bone density compared to premature babies who were not “exercised”. Seems funny to think about exercising babies! It makes sense though. However, I wouldn’t recommend this to a client without being confident in the specifics of such a regime. I don't have any data on postterm babies, except that their gestational age isn't associated with any increased risks as far as skeletal health is concerned.</p>]]></message>

<message><![CDATA[<p>This is really is dependent on the clients, if they breastfed, and how long. To be more detailed, I would say that calcium should be a primary consideration for those who become pregnant 6 months after they stop breastfeeding, or at least 6 moths after birth if they do not breastfeed.  Studies have shown that maternal remineralization can happen more quickly than that. Although when I did bone density scans, I personally witnessed significant bone density concerns in women for longer than just a few months after the cessation of breastfeeding. I was definitely erring on the side of caution with this recommending to account for those who practice extended breastfeeding, but it would be client specific. I’ll be sure to add this clarification to the content!</p>]]></message>

<message><![CDATA[<p>Yeah, like I said I don't have much data on 40 week +, but it's not so much that their bones are 'growing' during the final 6 weeks, rather that they're densifying and 'filling in' with minerals. Interestingly, after birth the bone gets less dense as it enlarges in circumference. To be honest, I haven't dived deeper than that to understand how that changes for premature vs full term, only because a) researchers are split on how this impacts long term bone health and b) there isn't really much we as nutrition consultant 'can do' to help in terms of recommendations for infant bone development in the early months. Esp as calcium in breast milk remain steady regardless of dietary calcium intake. Where it would be important to advise is in terms of maternal Vit D3 as many mothers are low, which does impact milk content and bone health, so infant supplementation would be suggested (if a mother is breastfeeding).</p>]]></message>

<message><![CDATA[<p>Ah yes I see... this is what the Health Intake is for. It's a great tool for finding out more about your client's (volunteer's) questions and concerns. Also for these volunteers we'll be wanting to share a little of everything with them to help you practice. So with a paid client we may focus only on their GBS or gestational diabetes during a consult, but for this consult, we'll be talking about some of all 'topics': nutrients, conditions, etc. Does that answer your question? I want to make sure that I'm getting it ;)</p>]]></message>

<message><![CDATA[<p>No need to apologize! This is a great question. I definitely advise against supplement overload. It can depend on the client as well. If someone is used to taking supplements, they may be open/wiling to take more. However, if supplements are new to them, then they could feel overwhelmed by too many. I also feel like someone may be eager to begin with, but might quit everything early if feeling overwhelmed by it. As a general guide, I usually chose 3-4 as my 'top recommendations' and then give a few more as 'optional but recommended'. After that I really try to emphasis food first.</p>]]></message>

Dairy allergies are actually covered the most extensively in Nutrition for Babies, and then again in Foundational Nutrition. Although the babies modules focuses on, well, babies... the info regarding allergies is applicable to everyone. I'm very confident you'll be well versed after going through both of those. Do you have a participant lined up for a Client Trial for with this concern?</p>]]></message>

<message><![CDATA[<p>Hi Lauren, I would actually recommend iron bisglycinate or ferrous bisglycinate which are better at repleting stores. Of course, with a strong focus on dietary sources too. Non-heme, plant-based (like Pranin) or herbal iron is best for maintaining levels and less efficient for repleting. Are you able to update her with this recommendation, or do you think she's purchased this already?</p>]]></message>

I just originally thought since she is already getting 27 mg from iron bisglycinate in her prenatal and she didn't want to do the liver capsules, the other one on your site would be a good recommendation. But, I will go ahead and get her on another iron bisglycinate supplement. Thank you!</p>]]></message>

<message><![CDATA[<p>Hi Carley, so her doctor prescribed her an iron supplement (yet to find out form) at a dosage of 300 mg/day. This seems insanely high... I will also say that her OBGYNs have not proven to be too knowledgeable about nutrition, so am wondering what your experience has been for proper dosing. She does not feel comfortable taking the prescription. From other sources I have found, it is recommended for women with a low ferritin level and anemia, to increase iron supplementation to 30 to 120 mg daily. And I also found it is better to take it every other day. Any thoughts on this? It seems like the recommendations for dosage is a wide range.</p>]]></message>

<message><![CDATA[<p>In regards to gestational diabetes, bananas is on the list of foods to avoid under high glycemic foods. It appears from searches, that bananas have a glycemic index of 51, which can be considered low. I was going to share a recipe that uses mango in a smoothie instead of banana, however mango is GI 55, so that actually wouldn't necessarily be better. Would you consider fruits at a 50 GI too high for GD? Or is it something else about bananas that are reason to avoid?</p><p>Thanks!</p>]]></message>

<message><![CDATA[<p>I think that anyone with GD should be cautious of all fruit. Although it really comes down to what it's paired with. (We cover this in great depth in Foundational Nutrition! There's a whole module dedicated to it.) While fruit such as a green apple or berries have a slightly lower GI and slightly more fiber (making their glycemic load lower) their sugar content is more consistent. Whereas the sugar content in a banana raises as it ripens. If recommending a banana I'd suggest a) going for one with no brown spots, b) eating half at a time, c) pairing it with fats/protein d) not eating it on an empty stomach by itself. Just keeping in mind that one large banana has 17 gms of sugar. This could be bad news for someone who has difficulty with insulin.</p>]]></message>

<message><![CDATA[<p>Hi Luka, if mother/baby are eating fermented foods regularly and are in good health, then a supplement wouldn't be necessary. However, the times when it might be recommended is if either of them have to take antibiotics, baby has eczema, etc. When introducing new strains or higher quantities, it can be expected to have tummy rubles and/or bloating while the body adjusts. I actually prefer fermented foods because the strains are more diverse, which help to strengthen the microbiome. As oppose to just taking 1 or a few stains in a supplement.</p>]]></message>

<message><![CDATA[<p>Sorry missed these Q's.... this is actually a question that is currently being proposed for research. <a href="https://www.groupbstrepinternational.org/suggested-topics-for-researchers.html" rel="nofollow noopener" title="https://www.groupbstrepinternational.org/suggested-topics-for-researchers.html">https://www.groupbstrepinte...</a>. GBS has been known to be passed through intercourse, but it's not a sexually transmitted disease and people who have not had sex are still carriers. Therefore, abstinence is not presently a recommendation made in the medical community. However, other research shows that GBS colonization is more common in "multiple sex partners, frequent sexual intercourse, and acquisition of a new sex partner" <a href="https://academic.oup.com/jid/article/198/9/1375/835055" rel="nofollow noopener" title="https://academic.oup.com/jid/article/198/9/1375/835055">https://academic.oup.com/ji...</a></p>]]></message>

<message><![CDATA[<p>Just wanted to add that for anal fissures, in many cases a person may need to go to a general surgeon because of the severity of pain and lack of healing with natural methods. In my personal experience calcium channel blockers are used in a topical ointment to allow the tissue to heal. Thought this was important to share because their is hardly any information about this and most people (including doctors, postpartum doulas and midwives) don't recognize the severity and pain that can come with this condition and therefore simply refer back to the basics like sitz baths and witch hazel leaving the new mom in terrible pain without solutions.</p>]]></message>

<message><![CDATA[<p>I will just have to bite the bullet (so to speak) and write about this subject. Sometimes the current practices of modern birth feel too disappointing to even address. The risk of PPH is drastically increased by the use of artificial oxytocin (inductions/augmentations). Also by coached pushing. Yet, if a woman hemorrhages, and the doctor 'saves her' she then goes on to say "thank goodness I was in the hospital". When in actuality, it was the often what happened in the hospital that lead to her PPH in the first place. I hope I'm not sounding too negative or accusatory. The PC Canadian in me often holds me back from being a full blown activist ;) If/when the learning material is updated with this topic, I'll ensure you have access to it. <br>Pitocin increases risk of PPH: <a href="https://bmjopen.bmj.com/content/1/2/e000514" rel="nofollow noopener" title="https://bmjopen.bmj.com/content/1/2/e000514">https://bmjopen.bmj.com/con...</a><br>Hospital birth has increased risk of PPH vs home birth: <a href="https://bmcpregnancychildbirth.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/1471-2393-12-130" rel="nofollow noopener" title="https://bmcpregnancychildbirth.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/1471-2393-12-130">https://bmcpregnancychildbi...</a></p>]]></message>

<message><![CDATA[<p>Hi Lauren, ohhh you got me. These both feel like sensitive subjects. I had anal fissures after my first birth. They are really terrible and brought tears to me eyes on many occasions. Sometimes I even felt like I was going to pass out. However, near the end of my 2nd pregnancy I developed a thrombosed hemorrhoid that was one of the most painful things I've experienced. I did opt for surgery after birth, which was also terribly painful. To be honest, I too felt very unsupported. My midwife was surprised I sought medical support and told me I should just "push it back in". Which is not possible with thrombosed hemorrhoids! All that (too much information) said, I'm still processing this and hope to be able to articulate this experience in a way that can help others (I'm not quite there yet - still feeling too raw about it). BUT I will update the learning material to suggest that indeed sometimes surgery is required. <br>Thank you</p>]]></message>

<message><![CDATA[<p>Yes absolutely. My best friend who had a C-section had two blood transfusions before leaving the hospital, and then hemorrhaged again two weeks later leading to a third transfusion. I imagine the best support is going to be iron-rich warming foods, but if there is anything else out there it would be great to know. She did not get any guidance on how to rebuild her self post hemorrhage.</p>]]></message>

<message><![CDATA[<p>THANK YOU for sharing. You are the first person I have ever met that had one as well. No one can understand the lack of support and the excruciating pain that can come with this situation, and the fact that there can be lasting effects (I am 15 mo postpartum and things are not back to normal). At some point, I would love to speak directly about your experience with the surgery in case that is what I may have to do.</p>]]></message>

<message><![CDATA[<p>It's terrible to hear that she wasn't supported. PPH can lead to increased fatigue and low iron can even have an impact on breast milk production. You're right that women need more support in this area. I'll be sure to create this and give access to those who have already progressed past this module.</p>]]></message>

<message><![CDATA[<p>It's mentioned a couple of times to avoid pasteurised dairy as it's an inflammatory food. Does this only apply to pasteurised dairy? I thought that all dairy was inflammatory. And also that <i>pasteurised</i> dairy can exacerbate constipation. Again, is it only pasteurised or all dairy? Thanks :)</p>]]></message>

<message><![CDATA[<p>Hi Eve, In Canada raw milk is actually illegal, so under my title as "Registered Holistic Nutritionist" I'm *technically* not allowed to recommend or advise on illegal substances (except to say that I don't recommend them). However, many people find that raw dairy isn't constipating in the same way that pasteurized dairy is. As for inflammation, raw milk has more anti-inflammatory properties than pasteurized and many people with inflammatory conditions thrive on raw dairy. That said, if considering the consumption of raw dairy, I would be highly considerate of quality and the way it's been stored. Also that pregnant women and younger children are at higher risk when it comes to soft cheese and raw milk. If you haven't got there yet, module 4 in pregnancy dives deeper into this topic.</p>]]></message>

<message><![CDATA[<p>Hi Eve, happy to elaborate. "Illnesses" refers to any sickness that is caused by food, so essentially illness in this case would = any cases or instances of food poisoning. An "outbreak" (as defined by the Center for Disease Control) is the occurrence of more cases of food poisoning than would normally be expected in a specific place or group of people over a given period of time.</p>]]></message>

<message><![CDATA[<p>Hi Carley<br>These are my notes on the module!<br>I think a section on recovering from PPH could be great - not so much in avoiding PPH as you've mentioned below as I agree syntocinon and hospital births play a huge part.. however more the recovery if a woman does have a PPH - how to deal with significant anaemia or what affects does a blood transfusion play on their postpartum health? I know in my experience as a midwife we check the hb immediately and then prior to discharge but then theres really no follow up - I usually recommend for the woman to stay on their prenatal multi and if they were taking iron supplements to continue until the 6 week check but its really not discussed enough! <br>Also on that topic.. if a woman does need iron supplements in pregnancy, loses a normal amount of blood at birth then is it necessary to stay on supplement until the 6 week check?</p><p>Couple of other notes.. what about support postnatally for women who had pre-eclampsia? As I know that birthing the placenta is generally the cure but surely the effects on the kidneys and liver could be supported? especially as it can take quite some time for blood pressure to normalise.. and what about when magnesium sulphate is given in labour the effects of that postpartum?</p><p>Also.. with mastitis have you heard of colloidal silver as a preventative/treatment?? and with the lecithin do you have this always to avoid plugged ducts if you're susceptible or do you just take it when symptomatic??</p><p>Also wanted to note with thrush that something commonly misdiagnosed as thrush is just milk on the tongue! I see it daily at work.. :)</p><p>Appreciate your answers, thank you!<br>Luka</p>]]></message>

<message><![CDATA[<p>Hi Lauren,</p><p>Thank you for bringing this up. I'll definitely add this to the learning material as I always want to present all information available to help enable parents to make an informed choice. One big benefit is that women get tested for hep B in early pregnancy. Of course, there is a chance that someone may be infected after this but the chances do become drastically reduced. While it does seem that donors (who donate without compensation) take precautions to see that their milk poses no risk to the babies who receive this gift - there is always the element of unknown. In medically run milk banks the donors are tested prior to donation, but then the milk is also pasteurized, so there is always a trade off.<br>A statement I like from Breastfeeding USA, “As with any other health-related decision, mothers who choose to share milk informally need to weigh the risk versus the benefit to their babies. They need to take whatever measures they deem necessary to ensure the safety of the milk they are obtaining for their babies.”  <br>I will also note that the WHO does recommend 'healthy wet-nurse' as a healthy option for babies, “For those few health situations where infants cannot, or should not, be breastfed, the choice of the best alternative – expressed breast milk from an infant’s own mother, breast milk from a healthy wet-nurse or a human-milk bank.” <a href="https://apps.who.int/iris/bitstream/handle/10665/42590/9241562218.pdf?sequence=1" rel="nofollow noopener" title="https://apps.who.int/iris/bitstream/handle/10665/42590/9241562218.pdf?sequence=1">https://apps.who.int/iris/b...</a><br>Again, it’s important that we help parents properly access benefit/risk.</p>]]></message>

<message><![CDATA[<p>Hi Emma, I'm not totally dedicated to any particular brand of digestive enzymes. Although, (for Canadians) I do like Flora's Ultimate Enzymes. When it comes to postpartum, I like recommending one with multiple enzymes as this is more about supporting "overall digestion". As opposed to addressing one specific aspect.</p>]]></message>

<message><![CDATA[<p>Ah good question. This is actually one of the (very few) topics that I've chosen not to talk about publicly. From a personal standpoint, I did decide to encapsulate and consume my placenta and had a positive experience. I did it in my own kitchen with a dehydrator &amp; vitamix (so grateful for an openminded husband). But professionally I don't feel that there is enough conclusive scientific evidence. The scientific literature currently states "no evidence currently exists to support this strategy" <a href="https://www.ajog.org/article/S0002-9378(17)30963-8/fulltext" rel="nofollow noopener" title="https://www.ajog.org/article/S0002-9378(17)30963-8/fulltext">https://www.ajog.org/articl...</a> (Although I certainly don't agree with everything from the AJOG ;) Lastly, not all mothers have a positive physical/emotional reaction with placentophagy, and it's a topic that seems to divide people quickly. However, if I'm asked privately I do share that it was something I chose to do personally but that every mother needs to decide for herself.</p>]]></message>

<message><![CDATA[<p>Great feedback, thank you Luka.</p><p>RE: PPH.... Yes I’ll definitely be writing about this and will make sure that this class has access to the recommendations when they’re complied. You’re right, it’s not discussed enough.</p><p>RE: Staying on iron supplement until 6 week check up.... Yes, this is recommended for as long as lochia is present (and beyond depending on mothers iron levels).</p><p>RE: Pre-eclampsia. This was covered in pregnancy.... While cases do definitely occur in the postpartum period, this condition is predominantly pregnancy related. (One of the tough things about creating this course is that pregnancy/postpartum are so interconnected that it’s often hard to draw a line when segregating them in this way!)</p><p>RE: Mastitis/colloidal silver as a preventative/treatment.... I have heard of this but only anecdotally. I can definitely see the value in using it in using it as part of a treatment. It’s ability to reduce pathogenic bacteria has been back by science. However, I would avoid using it as a preventive as studies have shown that it also reduces beneficial bacteria (as antibiotics do). If silver was to be used, it’s recommended to take it 2-3 hrs away from probiotics.</p><p>RE: Lecithin/plugged ducts.... Yes, this could be continued at the reduced dose if a mother was chronically susceptible to plugged ducts.</p><p>RE: Thrush. Great point ;)</p>]]></message>

<message><![CDATA[<p>Thankyou so much for your answers!<br>I personally am susceptible to blocked ducts so I was interested to know your answer! good to know about the colloidal silver! ive taken It before for mastitis at the recommendation of my naturopath and it worked wonders! but maybe I should get on the lecithin ;)<br>in regards to the pre eclampsia would you do anything postnatally to support recovery? I realise its a pregnancy issue but generally its picked up very late and delivery is imminent - so most of the healing would occur in postpartum and not sure if theres any supportive herbs or liver/kidney support or supplements we can recommend?<br>Thankyou!</p>]]></message>

<message><![CDATA[<p>Hi Julia, this refers to the questions you would like to ask her when you meet with her. After reviewing her health intake, are there questions you still have about her health? For example, maybe you don't see fish on her food journal. Does she eat fish? Would she be open to eating fish? What would you still like to learn about her before making your recommendations? I'm happy to jump on a call if you have more questions or would like additional help prepping for this.</p>]]></message>

<message><![CDATA[<p>Yes definitely! If a mother is unable to (or chooses not to) breastfeed, then "in general" these recommendations would be the same for at least the first 6 weeks postpartum. After that it would be dependent on their individual needs. For those who partially supplement with formula/donor milk, it would depend on how much. For example, if they breastfeed 50% and supplement with formula/donor milk 50%, then they could reduce their intake of recommended nutrients by 50% (between standard RDA and exclusive breastfeeding). That could either look like taking the nutrient every 2nd day or a half dose every day. I'll be sure to address this further during the Q&amp;A!</p>]]></message>

<message><![CDATA[<p>The recommendations would be the same, with the exception that that these nutrients are especially important for this mother. Any 'additional' would best be made up by being mindful to include food sources of the nutrients that you identify as important for her. This is with the assumption that the 4 year old is breastfeeding less frequently. Regardless of frequency though, nutrients such as vit D, DHA, and calcium become the focal point for those who practice tandem nursing.</p>]]></message>

<message><![CDATA[<p>It would really depend on the mother/baby duo... if either she or the (breastfed) baby were sensitive to any amounts of caffeine. While it does contain caffeine it is usually substantially less than coffee. In this way, a mother who is attempting to consume less coffee might enjoy some raw cacao powder with steamed almond milk. Although it's still probably best to limit the consumption of both before bed.</p>]]></message>

<message><![CDATA[<p>In an ideal world I would recommend that they stop taking their current brand and switch to a prenatal multi with methylated folate. In people with problems converting folic acid to folate, folic acid can be problematic and actually prevent their bodies from absorbing dietary sources of folate properly. In cases where a woman doesn't want to "throw/give away" her current prenatal, I'd suggest buying a brand with methylated folate and alternating every day until she's run out of her first brand. However, if she's in her 1st tri, I'd suggest using only the brand with  methylated folate until she's later in her pregnancy and then alternating brands. Or, see if the store they purchased it from will allow for a swap!</p>]]></message>

<message><![CDATA[<p>Hi Lauren, I did come across this much more frequently when I was practicing general nutrition, but very rarely now. Regardless, this is always something that I refer out for in my practice. I find that these clients require more psychological support than I (personally) feel qualified to provide. I actually cover this in business development... deciding which topics and level of support falls inside your practice and skill set and then building a referral team to fill in the blanks. For me (personally) that's birth trauma and disordered eating. Ideally I'd *love* to have someone to refer to who supports both prenatal nutrition and birth trauma/disordered eating. Maybe this is an area that someone from this course will choose to specialize in one day.</p>]]></message>

That seems to be an important distinction, unless there are other studies with broader findings that aren't included.</p><p></p><blockquote>"Although no overt toxicity is associated with the consumption of soy-based infant formula in healthy infants (13), a recent clinical study (14) has reported the development of abnormal thyroid function from the ingestion of soy-based formula in infants with congenital hypothyroidism. Data from animal studies (15) suggest that phytoestrogens can inhibit thyroid peroxidase, potentially lowering free thyroxine concentrations, which could lead to abnormal thyroid function. Therefore, infants with congenital hypothyroidism who are fed soy-based infant formulas should have their thyroxine levels monitored. This does not appear to be a problem in infants with healthy thyroid function."</blockquote>]]></message>

<message><![CDATA[<p>Hi Luka - I agree with you, the ingredients are ok but for the price I would try to help her find an alternative. A few things... the fruit/veg aren't organic and the concern is that when the produce is concentrated, so are the pesticides/herbicides, etc. In an 'ideal' world we'd also look for something without magnesium stearate as well. In terms of the omega, the primary omega for postpartum is DHA and as you noted, the quantity is on the low end bc the product is some algae oil mixed with other (non-DHA) oils. However, this may be ok if she was not breastfeeding or breastfeeding very little. She could switch these for an all-in-one fruit and veg organic powder mix and get a new DHA. But this wouldn't replace her prenatal. I would only suggest the powder mix 'in addition' to a prenatal (if she was still breastfeeding) as it has many other supporting nutrients that she would require. If she already has the product and doesn't want it to go to waste, she could just continue taking every second day or so. Feel her out and see what she's open to.</p>]]></message>

<message><![CDATA[<p>Not a silly question! The breast will feel less full and much softer to the touch. Often babies will only need to feed on one side for a feed. But if they're hungry and having a full "meal" (vs a milk-snack) then they'll want the other side as well. At this time a baby could also pull off and/or get a bit fussy (bc the milk is coming out too slowly). Once a baby is bit older and has a bit of neck control, they'll usually just switch sides on their own ;)</p>]]></message>

<message><![CDATA[<p>It is known that soy is highly goitrogenic, which can impact thyroid function. This gets a little tricky for a few reasons though. Many holistic practitioners believe that the medical parameters for hypothyroidism to be much too narrow and that people with subclinical hypothyroidism still benefit greatly from support. Therefore, seeing a range within “normal” could potentially not be ideal for babies. Although the sample size is small, this study (<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/2338464https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/2338464)" rel="nofollow noopener" title="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/2338464https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/2338464)">https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.go...</a> has linked soy formula to the development of autoimmune thyroid disease. So while it may not alter hormones levels immediately, it could make a difference later. Admittedly, soy is a controversial subject! But regardless, with the other concerns that soy formula may present, I strongly believe that there are better options for babes.</p>]]></message>

<message><![CDATA[<p>I actually do know of one study that mentions that paternal use of isotretinoin in the preconception period with the potential for negative outcomes (<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3612732/)" rel="nofollow noopener" title="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3612732/)">https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.go...</a>. Although, I did a little more poking and saw that this paper interestingly suggested that "There has been no known adverse effect on the pregnancy if a man taking isotretinoin fathers a child. However, as isotretinoin is present in semen, it may be a sensible precaution to use a condom to avoid transmission of any of<br>the drug to females." <a href="http://www.bad.org.uk/library-media/documents/Isotretinoin%20(Male)%20Jul%202011%20-%20lay%20reviewed%20Aug%202011.pdf" rel="nofollow noopener" title="http://www.bad.org.uk/library-media/documents/Isotretinoin%20(Male)%20Jul%202011%20-%20lay%20reviewed%20Aug%202011.pdf">http://www.bad.org.uk/libra...</a> So less to do with conception and more due to transmission via semen to a pregnant mother. This is the first that I've heard of this - and to be honest - my MIND is BLOWN.</p>]]></message>

<message><![CDATA[<p>Hello, I am currently working on the postpartum client trials and I have a doubt regarding one of the questions on the intake form. It asks "how much weight" the client would like to lose (if any), and I'm not sure what to do with this information. Why do we ask "how much" if we can only provide general guidelines on losing weight postpartum, regardless of the amount of weight? Both volunteer clients are past the "fourth trimester"but they still breastfeed, so could they be more proactive about losing weight? This is their primary concern. One would like to lose 10kg, the other is unsure... Thanks!</p>]]></message>

<message><![CDATA[<p>Hi, these questions are on the intake to get a sense of how much of a concern "weight" may be for your clients before meeting with them. You're right that the approach would be similar regardless of 'how much' a client wanted to lose. Although, I sometimes have clients who are very concerned about weight and are looking for more of an aggressive "weight loss diet" (as indicated on their health intake). As this isn't something that I offer, I like to get an indication of where my clients are at before we meet. This may also help to offer some insight as a symptom to a condition such as thyroid dysfunction - along with other symptoms also present (of course not always). Just trying to gather as much information about their current health and also goals for the consultation.</p>]]></message>

<message><![CDATA[<p>Hi Carley<br>In regards to prenatal supplements - if the ingredients listed are just all minerals and vitamins (and not wholefoods) does that mean that they are synthetic? Eg the brand bioceuticals InNatal (which is what my naturopath recommended).or eagles treso natal. because to me the ingredients look similar to anything you can get at a local supermarket (eg elevit which is our most commonly prescribed prenatal) <br>Just confused what to specifically look for ingredient wise if the women can’t get their hands on or can’t afford the wholefood capsules?<br>Also if someone feels ill on the prenatal (even postnatally) is there anything that may cause that or can change? Eg iron? <br>Thankyou!</p>]]></message>

<message><![CDATA[<p>Although I do believe that children often require higher quantities than what is typically recommended, I'm hesitant to do so without having their blood work tested by another practitioner first. Without this, it would be dependent on whether or not they're breastfeeding, if they are plant-based (6m+), and how much they are eating. This makes it difficult to provide general recommendations.</p><p>Regardless, the 'standard' recommendations are:<br>* D3: 400IU (formula fed babies receive D3, although I'd be inclined to go higher for a breastfed baby if the mother isn't supplementing herself at higher dosages). <br>* DHA: requirements are quite high, up to 500 for 31- 40 lbs (weight dependent). Again very impacted by breastmilk/formula consumption. <br>* Probiotics: most manufacturers include up to 10 billion CFU/dose. Would want to ensure this for formula fed babies. <br>* Iron: this is something I don't often suggest supplementing unless there is blood work  and/or the baby is 6m+ and not eating animal proteins.</p><p>I'll definitely be sharing more about this on the first Q&amp;A for babies!</p>]]></message>

<message><![CDATA[<p>Coconut oil was suggested, but lanolin and a nipple cream would be good suggestions as well. Some studies have found that rubbing in hind milk is just as effective as lanolin, but I do know some mothers that find lanolin more soothing. Just note that organic is recommended as sheep are commonly treated with pesticides/insecticides. I also like the Earth Mama Angel Baby nipple cream (which is organic).</p>]]></message>

<message><![CDATA[<p>Hi! In the course material it states "However, if your<br>client’s baby is not considered high-risk and they’re digesting solid foods<br>without any signs of reaction or irritation, then this strict hypo-allergenic<br>approach is no longer considered necessary. Lower risk foods can be<br>introduced at a quicker pace or in combination with other foods." - does this indicate that high-risk foods as well do not have to be introduced every three days to see if there is a reaction if the baby is not considered high-risk and digesting foods well?</p>]]></message>

<message><![CDATA[<p>Hi, it is still best to introduce the high-risk foods with a minimum of a few days between each. With these high-risk foods, it's actually best to introduce them a few times in a row (waiting a few days in between) as reactions are more likely to occur with consecutive introductions.</p>]]></message>

<message><![CDATA[<p>Hi! I don't know if this is best here or in postpartum, but my question is about the right protocols for women that are breastfeeding and who have received a "diagnosis" as their baby has food allergies (dairy, gluten..), based on a stool sample and the baby having blood in their stool. Do you have any knowledge about the accuracy of these stool tests? Also, what is the best course of action besides avoidance of these foods - probiotics (mom and baby), and perhaps digestive enzymes for mom (when in contact with allergenic foods)? I think these diagnosis make it really hard for mother's to get enough nutrition on restricted diets, and it can potentially lead to ending breastfeeding early, so I was wondering if you had any insight. *Maybe a question for a Q&amp;A.</p>]]></message>

<message><![CDATA[<p>Yes, stool sample is thought to be quite accurate. They're just less sensitive than skin prick, so practitioners sometimes start there. A stool sample is less invasive though. As for mother's diet, it would depend on how many food allergies have been identified in her baby's diet and the severity of their allergic response. Support is important for these mothers as breastfeeding has been shown to be especially beneficial for babies with allergies. If dairy-free, it would be ensuring she's familiar with plant-based sources of calcium. As for gluten, there is no nutritional deficiencies that are at risk - just ensuring she is aware of alternate whole food carbohydrate sources. Eggs would be choline, fish / DHA, and nuts / healthy fats. Other than your recommendations, avoidance is the primary recommendation. I can definitely elaborate on the next Q&amp;A!</p>]]></message>

<message><![CDATA[<p>This is difficult because it is not the norm, but I highly (highly, highly) recommend just being chill about it. Of course, that doesn't mean that we should ignore the likelihood of any potential (very rare) complications, but SO often there are unnecessary problems caused by this "issue". Obviously unnecessary stress, but also mothers doubting their supply, turning to formula, or who end up trying to "fill up" their babies with breast milk, which often leads to excess spit up/reflux. Does baby seem otherwise healthy? Breastfeeding is going well? Are they alert (as much as babies are)? Honestly I don't feel that this is a situation where anything needs to "be done". I'd love to hear more about your experience with this.</p>]]></message>

<message><![CDATA[<p>This can be a bit tricky. An elimination diet can be successful with babies who have allergies (as it's more obvious and immediate) but this tends to be more difficult with food sensitivities. I usually reserve these recommendations and an elimination diet for babies who have already started solids. Although, low histamine strains would be great for both mama/baby, and glutamine/collagen could be useful via mama as well.</p>]]></message>

<message><![CDATA[<p>Unfortunately, I don't have any recommendations that I would feel comfortable making in this instance. It would be a matter of soy formula or an amino acid formula, which is dairy/soy free. The one I am familiar with is Neocate, but it's 54% corn syrup solids (amongst other concerns) - so I just wouldn't be able to suggest that as a recommendation that I could stand behind. I can only image that more options will be made available in the future. That aside, all formula contains D3 that is derived from sheep's wool, so no formula can be marketed as "vegan".</p>]]></message>

<message><![CDATA[<p>It depends on if her cycle has resumed yet or not. If it has, I am a HUGE fan of tracking your cycle (fertility awareness method). It's the only birth control I've ever used and it has allowed me to both avoid pregnancy when desired, and then achieve pregnancy on the first attempt both times. Personally I'm not a fan of contraceptive pills and how they alter your hormones, but I understand that everyone has different needs.

<message><![CDATA[<p>Yes, this applies to pasteurized milk. Technically raw milk is not 'legal' in Canada, so I 'can't advise as a restriction of my designation', but if a parent wanted to introduce a non-vegan alternative to pasteurized milk before 12m, I'd suggest to ensure they are very cautious that it doesn't replace breastmilk in any way whatsoever. Smaller amounts is best, esp early on.</p>]]></message>

<message><![CDATA[<p>Hi Carley, I have a few lingering baby questions, so here goes :) :</p><p>1) Are there recommendations for babies experiencing diarrhea / vomiting (ex. methods for rehydrating or foods to offer or avoid while you identify the food trigger or if it's a virus)? What about colic or reflux (ex. do you remove acidic foods from the diet or include base ones)?</p><p>2) Is there specific nutritional support for babies with the cold/flu (ex. do you actually feed a cold and starve a fever)?</p><p>3) And are antibacterial first-aid ointments problematic for babies/children? Are there holistic remedies for cuts that you would recommend instead?</p><p>Thank you in advance!<br>-E</p>]]></message>

<message><![CDATA[<p>Hi Erica!</p><p>1) Probiotics and coconut water are best for diarrhea / vomiting. Activated charcoal may be appropriate in some situations (for children 12m+). Reflux is a big topic and others have asked about this, so I'll definitely be adding this to the curriculum. However, it likely won't be ready until the next intake. I will make sure that all students from this intake have access to it!</p><p>2) I tend to let baby lead the way and dictate their appetite. Lots of liquids, bone broth, coconut water, probiotics, elderberry syrup (not with honey before 12m+), vitamin C &amp; D, zinc rich foods.</p><p>3) These creams are known to be a risk for potential contact allergic reactions in babies. There are several natural brands, such as Homeocan first aid cream, or even Earth Mama Baby diaper balm (meant to sooth sore skin).</p>]]></message>

<message><![CDATA[<p>Ohh all good questions (haha!). It's more typical to see the above mentioned conditions in children over 1yr (I'd love to include a more detailed course for toddlers/children in the future - both foods and conditions!) As for whether antibiotics are suggested really depends on the severity of the infection. With ear aches, dairy is often very linked to this (esp pasteurized cow's milk with kids), many of my clients and my own family have had success with colloidal silver. Strep does go away on its own, but ABX is prescribed to shorten the length of someone being contagious. So that is a parents personal decision. Re sinus infections - that has been a challenging one in my own family as my mother suffers. Some people have success with colloidal silver nasal spray (my mom does not) and I've also seen probiotic nasal spray (depending on child's age).</p><p>The suggestions you provided for boosting immunity are wonderful!</p><p>Fluoride is a topics that that I tend to steer clear of publically. I will say that my own children do not use it at the dentist or in their toothpaste ;)</p>]]></message>

<message><![CDATA[<p>Hi, that isn't a common condition but pregnancy can definitely cause swelling in all parts of the body. We always want to rule out an allergic reaction first as this is also a symptoms of allergies. And infection of any kind. After that, in TCM swelling in the tongue is linked to "dampness or difficulty with fluid metabolism". If your client is open to it, I know that acupuncture can be a very supportive tool for this particular condition.</p>]]></message>

Which B vitamin, and what form is it in??</p><p> Carbohydrates, Protein: I've NEVER seen this in an ingredient list before ever. And I've been an avid reader of ingredients labels for decades. I can see this is the 'info' but these are not ingredients. Super weird.</p><p>Probiotics &amp; Prebiotics: what forms? Baby probiotics strains are very specific. It does list Galacto-Oligosaccharide (GOS) as a prebiotcs. Just to note - some babies may experience gas due to this, so something parents may need to watch for.</p><p>Vitamin A, Magnesium, Calcium : what forms?</p><p>Sunflower Oil, Canola Oil, Pressed Coconut Oil, High Oleic Sunflower Oil: are these cold pressed? Ideally I'd love to see no canola in a formula (or for any human consumption, but I'm probably dreaming.)</p>]]></message>

<message><![CDATA[<p>Hey, no problem! I feel like I've written about this company before but can't find where. My primary concern is that they are not organic. I know that not everyone can eat all organic all the time, but many of the fruit/veg in this product is on the EWG dirty dozen. These are dehydrated so you're essentially getting 'more' of them, which unfortunately also means more of the pesticides etc. If someone is going through the trouble of taking something like this, I'd always opt for organically grown. Second, I don't love that sugar is the FIRST ingredient in their shakes. Just my 2 cents ;)</p>]]></message>

<message><![CDATA[<p>When I had low iron during my pregnancy, my midwife recommend we try to get my iron levels up with natural supplements before trying prescription iron. I had to take 30mL of herbal iron, concentrated chlorophyll (200 mg/day), and a juice (spinach, beets, apples, lemons) daily for three weeks. And I was successful at bringing my iron levels up! What does this protocol do exactly? Why chlorophyll?</p>]]></message>

<message><![CDATA[<p>I always recommend that women take a prenatal multi, and they ALL contain folate (or folic acid) - so no need to worry about this for the most part. If this isn't the case, I'd say that supplementation is critical in the first tri, then the client could focus on folate rich foods if they no longer want to supplement.</p>]]></message>

<message><![CDATA[<p>This can get really tricky as the conversion for fat soluble vitamins (IU) to water soluble vitamins (mcg/mg) isn't always the same in the body as it is on paper. There are many factors that may limit this conversion. As such, I stick with the recommendation for vitamin A as it's much more reliable. Just to note - 10.000 is the upper limit, meaning that someone wouldn't want to have their daily intake go 'over' this amount. However, as mentioned in the course material, this is thought to be a very conservative recommendation.</p>]]></message>

<message><![CDATA[<p>That's great that you were able to boost your stores! This is a great option for someone with low stores, whereas sometimes someone very anemic would require heme iron.</p><p>Chlorophyll is though to increase RBC by aiding the cells to carry more oxygen. Chlorophyll closely mimics hemoglobin (in blood). The difference being that hemoglobin is structured around iron, while chlorophyll is structured around magnesium (but doesn't bind to iron). It's believed that taking chlorophyll can lead the body to think that "all this extra hemoglobin in the blood" is looking for iron and in turn, boosts iron stores.</p><p>As for the veggies, spinach has more chlorophyll, beets have non-heme iron, and apples/lemons are loaded with vit C to help with absorption.</p><p>Great midwife you have! :)</p>]]></message>

<message><![CDATA[<p>You're actually not the first student to ask about this product ;) I do tend to favor whole/fresh foods for babies, as such, the idea of a highly processed food with added salt (and what I can only imagine to be GMO corn) doesn't appeal to me. While a small taste strictly for the benefits of reducing an allergy risk isn't 'horrible', it's not something I'd personally endorse. Blending peanut butter into other fresh/unprocessed foods is also another 'slower start' to the introduction of peanuts.</p>]]></message>

<message><![CDATA[<p>Hi Eve, the best way to determine the quality of the supplement is to look at the forms of nutrients listed. Pure Encapsulations does include some high quality forms of the important nutrients. Especially when it comes to the B's, which are methylated. The minerals a good too. I don't love ascorbic acid, but mostly everyone consume food based vit C in their diets. If any symptoms/conditions come up that require vit C, I would reco an additional food based supplement. I will be sending out a more detailed list of supplements I like, but this one would be good to continue with - and I would also suggest she take 2 instead of one!</p>]]></message>

<message><![CDATA[<p>To be honest, OBGYNs receive very little if any training on the nutritional needs of pregnant women. Even while some of the government's RDAs are conservative, taking only 1/2 of the label recommended dose of a prenatal multi is insufficient. Ultimately it's up to the client to decide which advice resonates with her. But I'd go over the recommended daily intake of the primary nutrients and compare them to what's in the prenatal to get the best idea of the appropriate dose for your client.</p>]]></message>

I often will quote something from the course and I know it will come up when we are consultants, where the client will then ask where I found that research and all I can say is 'oh baby academy' and then try find my own research, im sure when writing this course you have tons of research to back up everything you say, and whilst I will always agree with everything you say, id love to have more solid evidence to back up some claims! hope thats ok to ask, luka xx</p>]]></message>

<message><![CDATA[<p>Hi Luka, yes absolutely! This course was built on all of the research I've done over the years, as well as researchers that I worked with when compiling this learning material. I'm sending some additional studies to Lauren and I'll be sure to send them to you as well. The content will continually be updated with new research (that you'll have continued access to) - I assure you that more research and links will be added on a continuing basis. All graduates will also receive updated research via our future newsletter. However, if there's anything specifically you'd like immediately, don't hesitate to reach out!</p>]]></message>

<message><![CDATA[<p>This recommendation is made by health organization (such as the American Academy of Pediatrics).

The difference between milk and yoghurt/butter is that they are much easier to digest. As you mentioned, fermenting reduces lactose and butter contains very little lactose as well (higher fat).</p>]]></message>

<message><![CDATA[<p>Some questions for tomorrow's Q &amp; A:</p><p>1. I am curious if you have commonly fielded concerns from parents about giving their child fermented foods at an early age?</p><p>2. For a babe dealing with histamine intolerance, what are some foods we can suggest to help heal their gut? I've read that bone broth is high histamine due to the long cooking time. Would gelatin or collagen powder be a more appropriate option or would these also be considered high histamine?</p><p>3. Can histamines be passed through breast milk?</p><p>4. Dosage for supplements - are they always based on recommendations for a 150 lb adult unless otherwise stated?</p>]]></message>

<message><![CDATA[<p>Hello! Regarding B12 supplementation, recommendations here is 5-10mcg per day (or 20-30mcg 2-3 times per week). I'm not finding any B12 supplements with that low of a dose (lowest is 500mcg, average 1000mcg), except for prenatals in which the range is around 5mcg. If a client is strictly plant based, can we suggest supplements with higher doses? For how long? Thanks for the insight :)</p>]]></message>

<message><![CDATA[<p>Hi Julia, if your client is strictly plant-based and ensuring to take the full dose of her prenatal daily, then the amount she gets from that will be enough to meet her needs. If someone is not taking a prenatal, then additional supplementation would be required. It's considered safe to take B12 at higher doses as it's water-soluble and the body excretes what it doesn't need through the urine (even sometimes skin if doses are really high!). Therefore, 5-10mcg is the daily requirement, but more than that is ok as well. Methylcobalamin is preferred.</p>]]></message>

<message><![CDATA[<p>Hi Carley<br>I have a few questions for the next Q&amp;A.. sorry I haven't made it to any of the last ones I have had no reception travelling but im hoping to make the next one! Lots of questions for you!</p><p>What is the dosage of cod liver oil for under 1 year old? Will dosages of the recommended supplements be something that is given to us when graduated?<br>What would be your advice for a 'shover' of food.. a child who eats too fast and causes themselves to gag!?<br>Do you have a list of foods on when they are appropriate to introduce? I don't mean allergen foods, just more say when foods like mushrooms, or dates etc can be introduced? Eg some things say no banana for 9 months and some say its fine from 6?! Do you follow a timeline for foods such as these? or only for foods that could be harder to digest eg grains? And if so, do you have a resource we could use for this timeline?<br>If a mother is coeliac do you still follow the same introductory timeline for babies to introduce gluten but consider them to be 'high risk'? <br>For a baby diagnosed with CMPI would you introduce any dairy?<br>Have you heard about giving protein to baby at lunch to help with sleeping? Ive been hearing this a bit lately..?<br>Also, I know you kind of answered this in the last Q&amp;A.. but if a baby won't eat anything, when would you be concerned about their iron? <br>When can you stop sterilising and giving sterile water? I have read that sterilising is no longer recommended..?</p><p>THANKYOU!</p>]]></message>

Kefir would be a great option too. I'm not sure where your participant is located, but in North America there is Zevia - an additive/color-free pop sweetened with stevia. I still wouldn't encourage chugging it often, but it can be a helpful transition off of soda. Naturally flavored soda water could be an option as well. Good luck!</p>]]></message>

<message><![CDATA[<p>Hi, I’m confused about the the Case Study format, as in how to write my assignment. Are we supposed to have it in the exact format that the Example Case Study Response is in? As I would have thought to answer the questions 1-4 that were asked in Assignment 1, rather than writing it in the format of the example response. Are we to do the additional research on teas/leafy greens/additional food sources of the vitamins/minerals as seen in the example response to incorporate in our own response as well?</p>]]></message>

<message><![CDATA[<p>Hi, I replied this on the assignment discussion board but wasn't sure if it would be only read here. I was just rereading the response to my assignment and am a little confused!</p><p>In the markers response to my assignment, it was replied to my recommendation of "taking a prenatal with folate plus an MTHF supplement" that she should find a prenatal with folate or MTHF, but not take a prenatal with folate AND take a separate supplement of MTHF. However the reason Im confused is because on the folate information page in this module, under "Is eating folate-rich foods enough?" It is written "I recommend  supplementing with 5-MTHF in addition to a whole foods prenatal multivitamin that contains folate"</p><p>Just concerned for future reference!</p>]]></message>

<message><![CDATA[<p>In India, we primarily have health care providers prescribing supplements separately in the form of:<br>1. Iron (throughout pregnancy)<br>2. "folic acid" (seldom is folate prescribed)<br>3. Calcium/ Multivitamin for calcium/D3 etc<br>4. In case of known history of D3 deficiency (d3 deficiency is extremely common in India) a D3 supplement too. like wise for b12.</p><p>My questions:<br>-"Prenatal vitamin/supplement" is something that isn't prescribed by the ALL obstetricians/health care providers, what is it that I must be doing in those situations because it would definitely not work to my advantage to have the client go against her doctor  &amp; stop/change all the prescribed medication. Will lead to professional conflict and reduced client compliance.<br>-Same as Michelle's question: What are some of the preferred prenatal vitamins brands used in the USA/Canada that I could use as a bench mark to find Indian alternates.</p>]]></message>

<message><![CDATA[<p>Hi Charl, you are correct that advising a separate activated folate is worthwhile in early pregnancy. I'll be sure to follow up and review your evaluation! Thanks for bringing this to my attention. For future, the best way to receive a response in regards to your assignments is through email (academy@ohbabynutrition.com) as this is monitored by your evaluators (Lauren &amp; Erica) directly.</p>]]></message>

I can tell you that there are so many thing "I wish I would have know" or done differently with my own little ones. It's all part of the process with motherhood ;) I'll be sharing a list of some of my fave brands in this week's module.

You have brought up excellent points about both common deficiencies and doctor's prescriptions and client compliance. I'll be sure to elaborate on both of these points on our live call this week. These are perfect areas to further explore and discuss best protocol to ensure we do not provoke professional conflict.</p>]]></message>

<message><![CDATA[<p>I’m confused about beta-carotene vs. active vitamin A, how much beta-carotene does one need to consume to reach the equivalent of daily required VitA of 10,000 IU? These are my calculations: 10,000IU VitaminA = 3,000 RE = 18000mcg of beta-carotene = 18mg of beta-carotene… is this correct? So if a client drank 1 cup of carrot juice (20mg beta carotene), they would meet the daily requirement of VitA? That doesn’t seem like enough?</p>]]></message>

I ask because the Smarty Pants prenatal complete gummies seem to meet a fair amount of the requirements for a decent food based prenatal (ignoring the fact that they obviously contain sugar which is not ideal). I’ve found that gummies are often recommended to women who typically forget to take there prenatal vitamin because they are yummy and who could forget their gummies! “A spoon full of sugar makes the medicine go down” kind of approach.

<message><![CDATA[<p>One more! :) ...Already I am having a hard time not incorporating lifestyle suggestions that I know to be helpful (through an additional scope of practice that I happen to have in my personal toolbox) in the Case Studies. I’m sure that we are going to discuss scope of practice as a Nutrition Consultant at some point in the future but can you briefly comment on how we might need to keep recommendations strictly diet and supplementation related and not so much lifestyle (i.e. recommending some deep breaths to center oneself before a big meal)?</p>]]></message>

<message><![CDATA[<p>I love that you bring a unique perspective to this practice because of your previous experience! It will surely serve to help you be a very well-rounded Nutrition Consultant. As for bringing in key aspects of lifestyle recommendations, we highly encourage this when working with clients! However, for the sake of the assignments, at this point, we really just need to see that you're understanding the learning content, which this week happens to be strictly diet and supplementation. When it comes time to do your Client Trials, that will be a great place for you to add in more of your advice for lifestyle recommendations.</p>]]></message>

<message><![CDATA[<p>Great question. I do really love that this brand has methylated B vitamins. I also love that it uses acerola cherry for vitamin C, and that it has no artificial colors or flavoring. As you mentioned, the sugar can be an issue for some women, and I do find an additional 7 grams to be on the high side for a supplement. We'll cover blood sugar in module 4 'Precautions for Pregnancy' and in module 3 'Pregnancy Conditions' we'll also talk about certain pregnancy conditions where it's strongly advised to reduce added sugar when possible. As such, I personally wouldn't recommend it myself when there are better options out there. However, on the call this week I'm going to be going over instances where the "next best: option could be more appropriate then the "ideal" option in some cases.</p>]]></message>

<message><![CDATA[<p>You're not alone! The conversion of active vitamin A to beta-carotene isn't that straight forward. It's not just the math that can get confusing, more problematic is the fact that these mathematical equations really only account for "best case of conversation" when there are several factors that could (and often do) inhibit this. While your calculations are correct, beta-carotene is much less potent than active vitamin A. Therefore the RDA is set for 75mg per/day during pregnancy.</p>]]></message>

<message><![CDATA[<p>It actually has to do with the fact that it's fortified with synthetic B vitamins (and in this case, folic acid). So anyone with methylation problems would do best avoiding it always, but it would be a special consideration during pregnancy (esp the 1st trimester). That said, you can find nutritional yeast that is non-fortified.</p>]]></message>

<message><![CDATA[<p>In most cases we tried to provide examples of raw and frozen/cooked. Whether you freeze the veg first, or cook from raw is very similar, as not much is lost through freezing. Freezing/cooking doesn't increase the nutrient value, in fact it lessens it, but in some cases (esp with spinach for example) the volume that someone eats would increase. In the case of okra &amp; Brussel sprouts, frozen/cooked is quite similar to raw/cooked.</p>]]></message>

<message><![CDATA[<p>I struggled with iron levels as a teen (not eating red meat) but experienced quite a positive shift (health/energy) when I started incorporating these foods back into my diet. I'm not saying this is necessary for everyone to thrive, but it's great to listen to your body and what it calling for in different stages of life. Especially postpartum like you! It's pretty incredible to think how traditional cultures treasured organ meats, but we tend to shy away from them. This is a great post on the topic with accompanying studies: <a href="https://www.marksdailyapple.com/does-the-liver-store-toxins/" rel="nofollow noopener" title="https://www.marksdailyapple.com/does-the-liver-store-toxins/">https://www.marksdailyapple...</a></p>]]></message>

<message><![CDATA[<p>Yes, blood level is really the gold standard for determining proper dosages. This particular review states, "The prevalence of Vitamin D deficiency {in India} ranged from 40% to 99%, with most of the studies reporting a prevalence of 80%–90%. If your clients are." <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6060930/" rel="nofollow noopener" title="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6060930/">https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.go...</a> I know that you're already well aware of the rates in your country. If doctors are prescribing 10,000IU (which is a refreshingly aggressive approach) see if your client's care provider would allow this to be in a fat containing capsule, or at the very least, suggest that your clients take this with a meal that contains fat. Of course, recommend vitamin D rich foods, as this review highlights "Our Indian diet generally fails to satisfy the daily requirement of Vitamin D for a normal adult."</p>]]></message>

<message><![CDATA[<p>That is quite a wide range between the two. If using this for its iron content, the organic version does seem like the better bet as it has more iron/less calcium. However, for the most part, as it is still pretty low in iron I wouldn't worry too terribly much. As someone would be likely be using it more as a food to add to their total iron intake vs their supplement to meet their daily requirements for iron. Unless the client was anemic/ had low iron levels.</p>]]></message>

<message><![CDATA[<p>Great question. Calcium tends to be a very common supplement that women consume during pregnancy, however, magnesium seems to be less so. Calcium and magnesium work in balance... by that I mean that calcium is constrictive in nature (allows muscles/heart to contract), whereas magnesium is a relaxant (relieves stress, aids sore muscles, reduces constipation). So is someone is taking calcium and is experiencing constipation, it's important that they ensure to also take magnesium. The study linked to was for this excerpt "Osmotic laxatives: Increases osmolar tension, resulting in increased water collection, distention, peristalsis, and evacuation." in reference to magnesium.</p>]]></message>

<message><![CDATA[<p>Ritual uses very high quality nutrients and I really like the brand. I've even contacted them on a few different occasions to learn more about their sources and process. Each conversation has been reassuring about their quality. My reservation (and what stops me from recommending them as a top suggestion) is that they aren't complete with all of the nutrients I'd hope to see (as listed in the curriculum). I feel like this “could be an option” for some women, but not all A woman taking this would need to have a high quality whole foods diet and aware enough to fill the potential gaps in her supplementation.</p>]]></message>

<message><![CDATA[<p>A few notes on BioMedica... this is a bit tricky and can take a while to figure out. There are 2 types of multi vitamins: either sourced from whole foods or not. If a brand is not sourced from whole foods (like BioMedica), ideally we'd like to see high quality nutrients. Examples of this are methylated B vitamins such as B12 methylcobalamin vs cyanocobalamin. I'm not a fan of ascorbic acid (but most brands use it). It doesn't contain any DHA (would need to be supplemented additionally). Although the biggest concern is how low it is in minerals like calcium, magnesium and iron.</p>]]></message>

<message><![CDATA[<p>Hello!  In reviewing the information on calcium, I’m wondering if there is a reason why cows milk is not listed on the sources page?  I know goats milk offers more calcium as well as some other nutrients, but is cows milk not recommended at all?  Also, in line with that question, I’m wondering about the recent change to the Canada Food Guide, taking Dairy off as a food group and adding some dairy products (in moderation) under the protein section instead.  There is some research now showing that humans (including young children) don’t need to consume animal milk at all, and should get their calcium from other food sources.  Carley, what are your thoughts on this?  Thanks!</p>]]></message>

<message><![CDATA[<p>Ohhh this conversation is such a big one! I actually go into more detail in Foundational Nutrition. I believe that the pasteurization process makes milk very difficult to digest. This is especially true for young children, and in Baby Nutrition we explore the relationship to milk and allergies/eczema. Unfortunately there is a very high rate of antibiotic use in the dairy industry as well. On the flip side, raw milk is not legal where we live. We'll also explore potential risks associated with raw dairy in Pregnancy module 4. While raw milk may be an alternative for some, pregnant women and babies are considered higher risk. Overall, I don't promote pasteurized milk, but would really encourage anyone who drinks milk to source organic, grass-fed. As for other dairy, fermenting it (yogurt/kefir) substantially increases nutrient value and digestibility, and something like butter or cheese has much higher fat/lower lactose.</p>]]></message>

<message><![CDATA[<p>Hey Carley,</p><p>Curious what your thoughts are on Floravital Iron + Herbs supplement for anemia protocol: <a href="https://www.florahealth.com/us/products/floravital-floravit/" rel="nofollow noopener" title="https://www.florahealth.com/us/products/floravital-floravit/">https://www.florahealth.com...</a></p><p>The same company also makes Floradix Iron + Herbs which is pretty much the same formula: <a href="https://www.florahealth.com/us/products/floradixiron/" rel="nofollow noopener" title="https://www.florahealth.com/us/products/floradixiron/">https://www.florahealth.com...</a> <br>... but I think I would recommend Floravital because it is the yeast and wheat free version. I'm actually not sure why anyone would prefer Floradix over Floravital. Is it more effective? Thoughts?</p><p>Does the dosage seem appropriate? Thanks!</p>]]></message>

<message><![CDATA[<p>Hi Emma, yes I am familiar with these products. When it comes to anemia, I much prefer iron bisglycinate because it has a high absorption rate and is easier on the digestive system. It is absorbed differently than dietary iron as is less likely to bind to oxalates and phytates from food which can impede absorption. Both Floravit and Floradix use ferrous gluconate, which is not absorbed as efficiently. If someone really preferred this product, it may be ok for helping to maintain healthy iron levels, but I wouldn’t suggest it to support anemia.</p>]]></message>

Nestle in general is much more known for mass producing with low cost ingredients rather than using top quality ingredients to support health. A few points: the B vitamins aren't methylated, long list of unnecessary "non-medicinal ingredient" fillers, and just low quality nutrients across the board.</p>]]></message>

<message><![CDATA[<p>Conventional pregnancy advise does recommend to avoid lying flat on the back after 20 weeks. Although I really advise women to listen to their bodies (if this is something they're accustomed to doing). Often times, your body will "tell you" something isn’t right and that feeling will inspire you to move around. Myself, I did still lye on my back here and there, but would opt for my side for sleeping. Some cues to watch for: having a little trouble breathing, heart beat faster, or even feeling a little light headed, then that's the body’s way of saying you need to roll over on your side/move. While the left side is "ideal" both sides are preferable to the back. In closing, some women roll to their backs without knowing it while asleep. This is okay and not to worry, but it's really advised not to spend all might flat on your back after 20 weeks when possible.</p>]]></message>

<message><![CDATA[<p>Testing for the gene variations (that determine conversation) is really the primary way. When it comes to water soluble vitamins (like B9/folate) once converted, the body absorbs what it requires and excretes excess. If your urine is bright yellow, but you're well hydrated, then you may be taking B vitamins in excess of what your can absorb.  There are some instances where the urine can be tested to see if nutrients are being absorbed, but this is usually reserved for studies, not in a clinical setting. Malabsorption can happen with digestive complications are present, but these are diagnosed using other presenting symptoms. If nutrients are not being absorbed (and there are no digestive issues) then it's likely due to poor quality nutrients with limited absorption rates. Or if certain medications are reducing absorption.</p>]]></message>

<message><![CDATA[<p>Generally speaking, it is best that all women in the 2nd/3rd trimester supplement with iron as requirements are so high that it usually becomes difficult to meet these through food alone. That said, if someone us taking a prenatal multivitamin, these contain iron. As for testing (in North America) it's standard practice of care to get tested for a CBC (complete blood count ), which shows the number of red blood cells and whether you have a certain type of anemia. Hemoglobin below 110 g/L (gram/liter) or 11 g/dL (gram/deciliter) can be regarded as true anemia regardless of gestational age.</p>]]></message>

<message><![CDATA[<p>Hi Carley, what do you think of the prenatal multivitamins Full Circle Prenatal: <a href="https://fullcircleprenatal.com/products/full-circle-prenatal" rel="nofollow noopener" title="https://fullcircleprenatal.com/products/full-circle-prenatal">https://fullcircleprenatal....</a> and Seeking Health Optimal Prenatal: <a href="https://www.seekinghealth.com/collections/prenatal-vitamins/products/optimal-prenatal-240-capsules?" rel="nofollow noopener" title="https://www.seekinghealth.com/collections/prenatal-vitamins/products/optimal-prenatal-240-capsules?">https://www.seekinghealth.c...</a> They both have high levels of many nutrients (eight capsules) and were the top recommendations from Lily Nichols' book Real Food for Pregnancy, which I started reading a few months back when I began researching preconception care. But, they both contain some preformed vitamin A (in addition to beta-carotene), and are not all whole food based. Would you not recommend them?</p>]]></message>

<message><![CDATA[<p>Unfortunately ascorbic acid is widely used in almost all multivitamins, even the better brands. On the call this week I'll be talking more about how there isn't really "one perfect" prenatal multivitamin, and how to help each client choose the one that's best for them. When it comes to vitamin C, while the multivitamins do contain ascorbic acid, if supplementing separately (when needed in a protocol) this is where you would recommend a different source.</p>]]></message>

<message><![CDATA[<p>1) These look great. I love that they're from grass-fed sources.</p><p>2) Yes!</p><p>3) If used during pregnancy. I'd just advise to use them in moderation as beef liver is advised occasionally in small amounts due to it being so rich in preformed vitamin A.  It's wonderful nourishing during the postpartum period. "Generally speaking" it would be good outside of these life phases, but it's hard to speak in general terms as everyone's needs are so different.</p><p>4) An excess of water-soluble vitamins are excreted, but this is different for minerals and fat-soluble vitamins (vitamin A, iodine, iron &amp; vitamin k2). Fat-soluble vitamins can build up to toxic levels with overconsumption. Minerals can be excreted when consumed in excess, but it can also be harmful to the body.</p>]]></message>

<message><![CDATA[<p>Yes, Europe and North America have differing views on the use of fennel during pregnancy. Fennel is found in some pregnancy tea blends here, and is commonly recommended by lactation consultants during breastfeeding. The studies I've seen have used isolated, purified compound found in fennel (estragole) only, and in very high dosed this could be toxic. Yet, the herb fennel contains many other substance that have a potentially protective role in counterbalancing possible effects of pure estragole. I've not seen any reputable studies myself that would warrant warning women against it's use. That said, if there's any chance of an herb's risk outweighing it's benefits, then it is something that should be discussed. I've removed fennel from the indigestion protocol and noted it's use in module 4 (Precautions During Pregnancy). If you come across any studies on the subject, please do pass them along!</p>]]></message>

<message><![CDATA[<p>Soaking nuts, seeds, grains and beans aids digestion. These foods contain phytic acid, which reduces mineral absorption. Soaking them activates the enzyme phytase, which reduces the phytic acid to allow for improved mineral absorption. You may see some packaged foods claiming "activated", this means that they have been soaked. You don't need a dehydrator, it can be done in the oven on a low setting. This is further discussed along with directions in Foundational Nutrition.</p>]]></message>

<message><![CDATA[<p>Great question, but one that unfortunately doesn't have a completely clear black/white answer. Everything in the module is about weighing the risk vs benefit. Something like raw, unpasteurized soft cheese carries a high risk. The benefits are that cheese contains calcium, but there are many other calcium rich foods as alternatives. In the case of eggs, there are one of the most readily available sources of choline, an important nutrient that the large majority of pregnant women are low in. First choice is that a women would eat cooked eggs, but what if she ONLY likes runnier eggs and doesn't eat any other sources of choline? You could try to suggest other choline rich foods, but also know that the risk of eggs drops substantially by consuming organic. Is organic an option for her? Also knowing that seeded veg carries a risk of 7x - yet women aren't warned of this. There are other factors to consider, such as immune strength. I'll be discussing this on our next live call because it can get relatively complex.</p>]]></message>

<message><![CDATA[<p>Pseudo grains are more well-balanced with some protein, yet they still contain quite a few carbohydrates. For example buckwheat has 33 grams of carbohydrate / 6 grams of protein. If someone suffered from significant blood glucose irregularities, I'd still prefer to see smaller portions that are further balanced. Such as quinoa added to a salad with other protein - vs a large bowl of only quinoa with some veg. It really depends on the person. Some people are okay with heavily carb dominated meals, while others require them to be more balanced. This is where really helping your client practice mindful eating comes into play.</p>]]></message>

In general I'm not that well-versed in the use of essential oils myself, but this episode sums it up quite nicely. You can definitely get the main points without listening to the whole thing (and skipping the intro). Hope it helps!</p>]]></message>

In the case of eggs, where 3% of food poisoning cases is related to salmonella, is this the only reason to buy organic (other than maybe a persons ethical standards)? Are there any other specific health outcomes from purchasing organic eggs, vs non organic eggs? 2) Some eggs say they have omega 3's added to them (a type of organic eggs purchased at Whole Foods) - thoughts on purchasing these? Is it okay that they have been "altered" from their original state to include this nutrient?</p>]]></message>

<message><![CDATA[<p>In Preparation For Birth pdf, under Reducing the Risk of Tearing during birth, I'm curious your thoughts about adding "applying hot compress to perineum during pushing phase". I did this during labor &amp; it saved my perineum (could never bring myself to do the perineal massage, even though I thought I would try, I didn't). My midwife suggests this to all her clients. We had a few face cloths in a small crockpot of warm water &amp; swapped them out whenever one would get cool. Needless to say - it felt amazing &amp; numbed the uncomfortableness! Also, no tearing! yay!</p>]]></message>

I'm finding conflicting information on whether it is safe to consume smoked fish during pregnancy and am very curious about your take on it.

<message><![CDATA[<p>It's more of a general recommendation. It's thought that this helps the baby descend and it also gives mothers in waiting "something to do". Of course, I'd always recommend stopping if someone experiences any discomfort. As for what to avoid, this is where it's best to listen to the body. Same recommendations apply at this stage as they do throughout pregnancy... nothing with a higher risk of impact, best to avoid lying on the back for extended periods, and avoid deep twists.</p>]]></message>

<message><![CDATA[<p>1) This is discussed a little more in Foundational Nutrition, but chickens that have access to pasture do produce much more nutrient dense eggs. This is easy to see when you have 2 side-by-side, as the organic (and especially pasture-raised) eggs are a much deeper orange. Their feed is organic, and they don't use antibiotics on a regular basis, as they do in battery cages. It's said that "it's not what we eat, it's what we eat has eaten". <br>2) See attached on egg labeling <a href="https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/8eaeffe411bfd89d5388e4ab09c02986230165b28f05ad759c6e23ddc2e3f138.png" rel="nofollow noopener" title="https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/8eaeffe411bfd89d5388e4ab09c02986230165b28f05ad759c6e23ddc2e3f138.png">https://uploads.disquscdn.c...</a>  and preferences.</p>]]></message>

<message><![CDATA[<p>Hi,<br>I'm curious about chicory root. I know it's listed as an herb to avoid. But, I recently was looking for a coffee substitution (5 weeks pregnant), and have found Teecino, caffeine free, "tea". It tastes like coffee and is delicious. But, just realized with our studying, the first ingredient is chicory root, and should be avoided. But would one cup really be harmful? I could see it being risky if large amounts were consumed. Would you maybe have any additional information you've gathered on this herb? If not, I understand!</p>]]></message>

<message><![CDATA[<p>thanks for answering my other questions. I have another question: im just doing the client trial and my client is low in iron and on an iron supplement. the supplement she is on doesn't seem great to me as it contains some synthetic ingredients (they all sound synthetic to me but they aren't all on your list in the supplement section for me to check).<br>Anyway I want to recommend her a better iron supplement, the one on your website isn't available in aus. I have been researching other options and nearly all contain absorbic acid. Also none of the wholefood's iron tablets seem to have a mg amount of how much iron will actually be consumed when having them, which is making it hard for me to know what to advise her to take. Eg I thought liver capsules could be beneficial with a wholefood's iron supplement however I dont know if that will be enough or not enough (in conjunction with a high iron diet) its not very clear.. any advice?</p>]]></message>

Evidence Based Birth did an excellent job at thoroughly covering this topic here: <a href="https://evidencebasedbirth.com/evidence-on-inducing-labor-for-going-past-your-due-date/" rel="nofollow noopener" title="https://evidencebasedbirth.com/evidence-on-inducing-labor-for-going-past-your-due-date/">https://evidencebasedbirth....</a>. I love how she not only discusses the studies, but also discussed their strengths and weaknesses.</p>]]></message>

<message><![CDATA[<p>In my opinion, chicory root falls under the category of "herbs to reduce or consume in moderation". Many pregnancy forums online warn of it’s use, and the Natural Medicines Comprehensive Database classifies chicory as “possibly unsafe to consume in large quantities during pregnancy” due to the fact that it is thought to be an emmenagogue (stimulates menstruation/may lead to miscarriage). Yet, as far as I've seen, there still isn’t any substantial evidence (or really any evidence at all) to back these claims. I was able to find reference to 2 studies that casually listed chicory as an emmenagogue, but without any statistical backing. Some mothers may prefer to stay away from chicory entirely, but I do believe that occasional consumption would be considered low risk.</p>]]></message>

<message><![CDATA[<p>Hi Luka, as this “client” has been identified as having low levels<br>I would recommend going with an iron or ferrous bisglycinate if possible. A non-heme (from whole foods/plants) is not as appropriate for raising levels, more just maintaining levels that are already in the normal range. If the only brands you can find also contain ascorbic acid, I consider this to be a trade that would be worth making. In terms of liver pills, these could be good to include - however, they are much less reliable in terms of how much iron they provide. So I wouldn’t count on them to meet this client’s needs.</p><p>I also wanted to mention that we are working on providing a list that covers more forms of various nutrients to recommend or avoid for a more comprehensive view.</p>]]></message>

<message><![CDATA[<p>The vast majority of research on both glucosamine and chondroitin are in relation to pain from cartilage degeneration due to osteoarthritis.</p><p>One of the best references of glucosamine’s effectiveness is a meta-analysis showing improvements in both pain and function. Although it does recognize that the results are not uniformly positive, and “the reasons for this remain unexplained”. (This is why you may see conflicting results.) However, when looking at studies under the comparative lens of the meta-analysis, glucosamine was superior to NSAIDs in 2/4 studies, and equivalent the other 2. <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15846645" rel="nofollow noopener" title="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15846645">https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.go...</a></p><p>Here is more on chondroitin: <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18674931" rel="nofollow noopener" title="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18674931">https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.go...</a></p><p>To add to this, ages ago I worked in a supplement store that had a predominantly senior clientele with joint pain.

<message><![CDATA[<p>Thanks Carley<br>Just to clarify, the wholefood's capsule I found contained 22mg or iron and 500mcg of B12.. the supplement my client has been taking contained 24mg of iron (amino acid chelate) and 250mcg of (Cyanocobalamin form) of B12.. so considering that the levels are just slightly lower in iron in the natural supplement and double in B12, would that not be a better option than iron bisglycinate or ferrous bisglycinate? is it because it won't be absorbed as well being whole foods?</p>]]></message>

What is your take on this and are there any other, more holistic remedies, you can advise on? Thank you!</p>]]></message>

<message><![CDATA[<p>This becomes difficult for a few reasons. While there may be other natural remedies of thinning the blood to support this, these have not been studied in relation to PAPP-A like aspirin has. Though my preference would be to recommend an alternative method, low dose aspirin has shown favorable outcomes.Even though these results are not always consistent, I do believe that the potential benefits of taking low dose aspirin for this condition could outweigh the associated potential risks, such as postpartum hemorrhage (studies are mixed). This is something I’ve thought about often as I wish there was more we know that would enable us to support mothers facing this decision. At this point there is a significant lack of information, and as such, I recommend these women consult with their care provider on the matter. Of course, recommend the protocol for gestational hypertension if PE or hypertension do become a concern.</p>]]></message>

<message><![CDATA[<p>Thank you Carley for your thorough response! This is indeed a tricky one, but I can see that it makes sense to tell clients that the potential benefit most likely outweighs the potential risks, which are rather small for low-dose aspirin. I hope there will be more research done into this! Thanks again!</p>]]></message>

<message><![CDATA[<p>Hi Carley!<br>Sometimes I really crave an in person lesson plan format with you, as I am always the person with her hand up constantly haha... hopefully you don't mind my virtual hand raised here! :)</p><p>Regarding Gestational Diabetes... from learning here in OBA and through Lily Nichols research and various research articles, I wonder where I actually had GD and missed in being diagnosed? Orlo was 9lbs 2oz when born, "macrosmia", which I read increased his likelihood of diabetes later in life? How accurate is this strictly based on weight? He is definitely a big boy, over the 100th percentile in both height and weight his entire life. When I was pregnant, I ate a healthy diet, but never worried too much about grains and carbohydrates. I am gluten free, however still had quite a bit of quinoa, rice, and some gluten free bread (getting away from that crutch again!). Instead of taking the Glucola for my glucose test, my doctor told me to just eat a heavy carb meal an hour beforehand. I now realize that likely wasn't a very accurate reading, especially as I also only had some gf sundried tomatoe pasta, so not sure how the fiber content and all other aspects of the meal contributed to my actual reading. I actually doubt now, that I reached 50 grams glucose for the reading.</p><p>However, I am a healthy individual. Overall, is it common for "healthy" individuals to be diagnosed with GD? I know you shared only 44% of diagnosed mamas have the pre markers so wondering what else contributes to actually having the onset of GD?</p><p>And further... IF that could even be the case, should I be watching Orlo's carb intake? We offer him various foods and try to give him nutrient dense meals, however sometimes he is still pick and choose... he love loves his fruit and larabars (again, trying not to give this to him too often!) Veggie straws have also been a crutch snack that I'm trying to get away from.</p><p>THANK YOU for your insight and helping me better understand this in a real life example!</p>]]></message>

<message><![CDATA[<p>Hi Kayla, Erica here. Carley is traveling with her family right now, but I know she appreciates your questions—and this is a great one. Generally speaking, we don't recommend limiting carbohydrate intake for little ones because the brain runs off glucose (made from carbohydrates, ideally in the form of starchy vegetables and fruits), and their brains are developing so quickly. I doubt that would change for Orlo at this point, but I'll make sure Carley sees this when she returns in a couple weeks. Stay tuned!</p><p>-Erica</p>]]></message>

<message><![CDATA[<p>Sorry about that! I meant to add that I would make sure Carley saw all of your questions.</p><p>I'm not sure how accurate the risk factor is based on weight alone (if there's no issue of gestational insulin resistance). As I understand it, the concern with gestational diabetes leading to macrosomia is mom's elevated blood glucose passing through the placenta, resulting in higher levels of fat for the baby, which can increase the likelihood for weight gain and diabetes later in life (doesn't mean it will). If Orlo was long at birth, too, though, it seems possible that he's just built bigger. (This is all speculation, though; I'm looking forward to Carley's feedback as well.)</p><p>According to the study cited in the curriculum, 44% of the women who were diagnosed with gestational diabetes had no risk factors—in other words, they had no history of diabetes, weren't overweight, didn't have PCOS, etc. Whether or not they were "healthy" is hard to say—after all, that's a somewhat subjective term. We don't know for sure why some women get gestational diabetes during pregnancy and others don't—although, we do know that maternal diet and lifestyle play a big role. I know Nichols mentions a link between low levels of vitamin D/magnesium and gestational diabetes. It also could be a continuation of an existing blood sugar issue that just hadn't been diagnosed until pregnancy.</p><p>Either way, still stay tuned for more. :)</p>]]></message>

<message><![CDATA[<p>I actually prefer around 9 months "after egg yolks have successfully been introduced" as stated in the introduction timeline. (If it's listed as 10-12m elsewhere, please let me know). Research shows that an early introduction (before 12m) helps to reduce both allergies and eczema, however, it hasn't been determined (from what I've seen) that 6-7 months is more advantageous than say 9 months when it comes to egg whites. As such, I've found 9m to be the best in my practice... being that it gives babies time to be introduced to (the more nutrient dense) yolks first, then whites after. Parents can definitely test whites at an earlier age. I've just seen that while some babies throw up after yolks, more often babies throw up after whites, which parents can sometimes misinterpret as a definitive/permanent allergy. Whereas, introducing closer to 9m greatly lessens the likelihood of babies throwing up after consuming whites (experienced in my practice only, not determined by research). All that said, this is such a growing field of research and I'm always looking out for new studies to help shape my current recommendations. Of course, I"ll always share what I come across with OBA students/graduates.</p>]]></message>

I am asked DAILY my thoughts on veganism, and my thoughts align with yours. I am constantly stating to mothers that they should see a nutritionist to assist with the extra nutrient needs that a plant based baby would require.. however, I would love to be able to offer this information when I do one on one consults. I think the vegan movement is only going to grow, especially with the release of the Netflix film the game changers. I would love love love any research or a whole module on this! I know you find it a touchy subject, but I do feel like this would be one of the main reasons that a mother might use our support xxx</p>]]></message>

<message><![CDATA[<p>For example (in reference to question below)... in one of the studies supplied, it states:</p><p>The risk of developing atopic eczema during the first 2 years of life in infants whose mothers received probiotics was significantly reduced in comparison with that in infants whose mothers received placebo (15% and 47%, respectively; relative risk, 0.32 [95% CI, 0.12-0.85]; P =.0098) ( <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11799376" rel="nofollow noopener" title="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11799376">https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.go...</a> )</p><p>If I understand correctly, that means that 15% of infants whose mothers took probiotics eveloped eczema, COMPARED to 47% of infants developing eczema whose mothers did not take probiotics... therefore (.15/.47 = 0.32, those who did not take probiotics have a 32% higher likelihood of having an infant develop eczema compared to those who do take probiotics. Does the P = .0098 mean that general population (regardless of controls) infants have a .0098% chance of developing eczema under the age of 2? This is where I get a little confused.</p><p>In another, different study, it also shows a hazard ratio (hazard ratio 1.98 [95% CI 1.08-3.63). Can you explain this one for example as well?</p><p>Thank you!</p>]]></message>

<message><![CDATA[<p>Hi Kayla,</p><p>You're correct about the risk. However, P is the probability that the findings happened by chance (and there really was no difference between the groups studied). General guidelines are that a P value of less than .05 means that it's very unlikely to be a random occurrence. Thus, in this study, the low P value demonstrates that there is a high probability that there is actually a true difference between the groups. In other words, the findings are statistically significant.</p><p>CI is the confidence interval that the range of numbers provided (in this case, .12 to .85) contains the population mean (average). This speaks to the study's applicability to the wider population (beyond the sample group) and factors in the size of the sample and the variability of the population.</p><p>Hazard ratios are a form of relative risk, but a bit more nuanced. Can you send me the link to the study you pulled that from? I'll try to put it into context.</p><p>Thanks, <br>Erica</p>]]></message>

<message><![CDATA[<p>Great question. In most cases, you'll find funding sources listed at the bottom of the research paper (either as a "thank you" or as a disclosure if there is potentially a conflict of interest). If you go to the full text of the study you cited below (<a href="https://www.jacionline.org/article/S0091-6749(02)25194-5/fulltext)" rel="nofollow noopener" title="https://www.jacionline.org/article/S0091-6749(02)25194-5/fulltext)">https://www.jacionline.org/...</a> and scroll to the bottom, you'll see "Supported by the Academy of Finland," which indicates some type of benefactor relationship (could be in the form of financial support, lab equipment, space, students, etc.). Sometimes it's explicit; sometimes it's not. If no funding information is provided, you can also look to the author's associations (companies, schools, etc.) to learn more about the funding trail.</p><p>-Erica</p>]]></message>

<message><![CDATA[<p>In GBS learnings, a suggested protocol is:</p><p>Coconut oil: Used for its antibacterial/antiviral properties.

Coconut oil can also be safely<br>inserted vaginally by coating a tampon with the oil and inserting it at night.</p><p>I find it surprising to recommend the use of tampon - especially overnight - as it is a foreign object inserted into the vagina, and with the sensitivity of the vagina to the cotton material? I understand it has coconut oil on it, however it is also recommended not to use a tampon for over 8 hours (although more and more women are steering clear from tampons altogether for good reason)... perhaps this is a whole other women's health conversation outside of pregnancy... any further thoughts here are appreciated!</p>]]></message>

<message><![CDATA[<p>I completely agree and am a strong proponent of alternatives to tampons! However, in this case, I do believe that the short-term use of a high-quality, organic tampon would be beneficial as a delivery method for the coconut oil. I have considered making coconut oil 'pellets' by freezing them and inserting, but the tampon does help to keep it in place more effectively. Covering it on coconut oil usually ensures that any discomfort from the cotton is avoided, although obviously each woman has to make that decision for themselves. The suggestion was to use the tampon overnight as if used during the day, the oil will leak out as it heats up/melts with body temperature. Used while lying down helps the oil to stay localized. Of course regular recommendations for tampon use still apply, so this is a consideration if someone sleeps longer than 8 hours per night and is unable to take it out within that timeframe.</p>]]></message>

<message><![CDATA[<p>It's quite hard to pinpoint when it comes to acne as it can be multifactorial. In general, recommendations for acne include fresh fruit/veg, antioxidant rich-foods, ensure adequate water intake, omega 3, and fermented foods. Some things to consider reducing are dairy, fried foods, trans fats, and industrial seed oils. However, if this symptom is specific to pregnancy then it's likely hormone related. While the same recommendations apply, she could also consider some liver support (as the liver helps regulate the balance of hormones by removing excess from the body). The recommendations under under the heading "additional natural remedies for PUPPS and obstetric cholestasis" in the PUPPS/Obstetric cholestasis protocol would apply. Best of luck with this participant!</p>]]></message>

<message><![CDATA[<p>Hi Kaitlin,</p><p>Great finds! As I've mentioned before, multivitamins can be difficult as there are no 'one perfect brand'. As you said, most have nutrients gaps in one area or another, each has their strengths and weaknesses. So it would be a matter of considering each client's needs to help you decide the best fit for them. You'd question the client's dietary sources of the missing nutrients, which trimester they were in, are if they'd consider supplementing with these missing nutrients separately?</p><p>As an example: in the Mama Bird Prenatal D3 is quite low, so additional supplementation is recommended.</p><p>Regarding red raspberry, it's common to see in a prenatal. From a marketing perspective, I believe manufacturers add it hoping women will think "ohhhh I've heard RRL is good for pregnancy". It's usually in small enough amounts, not enough to be a concern. Although if a client experiences heavy Braxton Hicks, they can switch brands and save the bottle for later in pregnancy.</p>]]></message>

<message><![CDATA[<p>Great question. As slippery elm bark is a mucilage agent, in theory it could possibly slow or even reduce the absorption of food/supplements/medications if consumed at the same time. While there aren’t sufficient studies to be sure, as a precaution it would be considered ideal to take sloppy elm on an empty stomach away from other supplements or medications. Many people find before bed to be the ideal time.</p>]]></message>

<message><![CDATA[<p>More can definitely be done to support a baby once they have stated solids. As for maternal diet, probiotics have been proven to be effective. I’d also suggest omega 3 for its anti-inflammatory properties, which do get passed through breast milk.</p><p>When it comes to removing allergens, studies haven’t been able to show the benefits of this. See the heading “Maternal diet supplementation while breastfeeding” in this study for more on that <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3237513/" rel="nofollow noopener" title="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3237513/">https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.go...</a> Anecdotally, some mothers do find it beneficial to identify possible tigger foods and remove them from their own diets. However, this can be difficult to do and may even lead to women ending breastfeeding earlier due to imposed restrictions. There is also the consideration that the consumption of allergens helps to inform a baby’s immune system and reduce the risk of allergies later in life.</p>]]></message>

<message><![CDATA[<p>It is really dependant on someone’s individual levels, so without knowing this you normally wouldn’t want to supplement beyond the regularly recommended dose. To get a better idea of your client’s needs, blood work would be necessary. Iron levels are routinely tested during pregnancy (in US/CAD) and if deficient, a woman’s care provider would then suggest an appropriate dose to replenish their stores. Sometimes this is difficult to rectify through more gentler forms of iron as the dose can be well above what you can achieve in an over the counter brand. In this case, the prescribed iron may be the best bet until there levels come up more.</p>]]></message>

<message><![CDATA[<p>Hello! One important question I have is: for women who develop a rash from maternity and menstrual pads, what suggestions for bleeding do you recommend?!  She jokes and calls it "diaper" rash but she also in her last pregnancy/nursing suffered from yeast/thrush. I can't help but wonder about the connection. I'm concerned the padsicle may be contribute to too much "wet" if this is the case. Thoughts? She also believes its the adhesives...and is not an overly sensitive individual at all. Fabric maternity pads? Absorbent underwear maybe? <br>Also, can you address at some point in our studies the significance (if you feel there is one) of methylated B vitamins? I have an MTHFR double mutation and suffered many problems until I learned about active truly whole food supplements...versus synthetic. The difference in my life was remarkable...I would love to share more if interested in my experience. I haven't yet dived into module two, but I see B12 is discussed soon!</p>]]></message>

<message><![CDATA[<p>Hi Cassandra, there are a few options as you mentioned... fabric maternity pads and absorbent underwear. These tend to be a little less absorbent though, so she would need to change them more frequently. If she isn't already using an organic maternity pad, that could possibly make a difference? Also, if she experienced yeast/thrush then an eternal ice pad would probably be more appropriate than a padsicle.</p><p>As for methylated B vitamins, this was discussed at great length in the Pregnancy Nutrition course. I'd be happy to email you the lesson on folic acid vs methylated folate!</p>]]></message>

<message><![CDATA[<p>Hope it's ok I chime in re: pads and bleeding. I have clients who prefer to free bleed while in bed for parts of the day. Layers of old towels underneath, a 'puppy pee pad' underneath their bottom. Legs open, but relaxed to air out the tissues and let everything breathe for a bit. Some like to have a fan blowing, especially if fresh out of the shower.  It seems to help, having these breaks from the constant moisture and protection from pads and underwear. When babies get diaper rash, it's often suggested to go diaper free for a bit, so same idea. :)</p>]]></message>

<message><![CDATA[<p>I was also hoping to learn a little bit more about the estrogen/histamine connection as well as the inflammatory aspect of prostaglandins if you have any thing to throw my (our) direction. I know that omega 3 helps balance prostaglandins, but it wasn't enough of an answer for me. I literally had a physical allergic response to almost all high histamine foods my first year-3 years postpartum...once I learned the signs of elevated histamine and taking an antihistamine/DAO as well as being religious with my MTHYL-5, I radically dropped my physical reactions to high histamine foods.  There are many ladies I meet who question arthritis/RA and histamine intolerance (maybe its a leaky gut thing?!….so many questions). When they mention undiagnosed autoimmune I start to panic because I truly feel as if gut health is key to shifting these reactions. I'd have to believe this would be out of our realm as a postpartum counselor! Not being able to consume wheat, oats, almonds or coconut, or whitefish, or walnuts...that was me. Oh, oranges and soy (all via an allergist!). How did I survive that and breastfeed for 5 years?! So much hard work.</p>]]></message>

<message><![CDATA[<p>Hi! Yes, ideally all probiotic-rich foods/beverages would be eaten raw for maximum benefits. However, there is some research showing that different strains (including lactic acid bacteria, bifidobacteria, and Lactobacillus rhamnosus) are able to produce beneficial effects in their heat-inactivated (tyndallized) form—for conditions that range from diarrhea to dermatitis. So, while heating does alter their benefits, they still may offer *some* benefits. As for SIBO and fermented foods, I like this post from Body Ecology. (<a href="https://bodyecology.com/articles/the-truth-about-fermented-foods-and-sibo/)" rel="nofollow noopener" title="https://bodyecology.com/articles/the-truth-about-fermented-foods-and-sibo/)">https://bodyecology.com/art...</a> I usually shy away from sharing "opinion articles" but I know the author and am confident that their work is always heavily rooted in research.</p>]]></message>

<message><![CDATA[<p>It does sound like very hard work, my heart goes out to mothers who are dealing with food restrictions! Although, it’s so incredible that you were able to identify your triggers and begin healing.</p><p>I find it so interesting that estrogen can down-regulate enzymes that break down histamine (DAO &amp; MAO). Yet while estrogen is high during pregnancy, DAO is produced at very high concentrations by the placenta “concentration may become 500 times that when the woman is not pregnant“ <a href="https://academic.oup.com/ajcn/article/85/5/1185/4633007" rel="nofollow noopener" title="https://academic.oup.com/ajcn/article/85/5/1185/4633007">https://academic.oup.com/aj...</a>, which is thought to be why food intolerance may decrease during pregnancy. Although during postpartum, even though estrogen quickly and dramatically declines (as estrogen can interfere with milk production), symptoms often reoccur because the body no longer has the placenta to produce excess DAO.</p><p>We get into histamine in the course for babies, as it focuses heavily on food sensitivities. But you are right that for postpartum this does typically fall outside the scope of a CNC. While it is related to hormones (which is related to pregnancy/postpartum) I consider this to be a condition that is pre-existing, and our primary focus in this program is to focus on conditions that are primarily pregnancy/postpartum related. Trust me that I’d love to dive deep into ALL of these topics, but the course would just be way too long. My ultimate goal would be that all OBA graduates would have different strengths/specialties and we could help refer clients to one another. Hopefully we’ll have a consultant that specializes in supporting symptoms of excess histamine!</p>]]></message>

<message><![CDATA[<p>Yes, I really love how you mentioned the potential links to mental health in this post and autoimmune disease in your last post. The RDA for a non-pregnant adult woman is 1,000 mg. I’m always to intrigued by the mechanism controlling demineralization of the maternal skeleton during lactation. Is this really the biological norm for most women, or would it otherwise be considered a safety net, only used occasional if needed (say when a deficiency of co-factors were present)?</p>]]></message>

I’m doing a big update on curriculum over the next 6 months and this will be an area that is elaborated on. I’ll discuss why babies would benefit from a diet inclusive of nutrients exclusively or predominantly found in animal-based foods, as well as how to support parents who decide to raise their babies strictly plant-based.</p><p>In the meantime, the same recommendation for plant-based eaters from Foundational Nutrition apply for babies as well. However, that’s more that WHAT and not the WHY. Time for a deeper dive into this important topic!! Thank you for this gentle nudge  out of my comfort zone ;)</p>]]></message>

<message><![CDATA[<p>Hi Kayla, great news! I know an amazing researcher who works in the realm of pregnancy/postpartum nutrition that would be a great fit for a live lesson, and we're in talks to create this resource for students. This would include how to find worthy studies, assessing who they're funded by, where to access research, and all of the great questions you've asked above! Stay tuned and let me know if there's anything else you'd like us to address on the lesson :)</p>]]></message>

<message><![CDATA[<p>“I wonder where I actually had GD and missed in being diagnosed? Orlo was 9lbs 2oz when born, "macrosmia", which I read increased his likelihood of diabetes later in life? How accurate is this strictly based on weight?”</p><p>- Studies do show us that the likelihood of having a large baby does strongly correlate to maternal blood sugar control. Although it’s also not always so black and white, as factors such as hight and gestational age aren’t taken into consideration.</p><p>“However, I am a healthy individual. Overall, is it common for "healthy" individuals to be diagnosed with GD?”</p><p>- Some studies have shown that it’s actually closer to 50% of women who test positive for GD don’t posses classic risk factors. While we can’t know for sure whether you had GD or not, I do not feel that eating a "heavy carb" meal is the proper measurement of testing. As you said, how much fiber did it contain, was there any fat or protein included? As it’s not standardized, we aren't able to test women using this method to produce reliable and consistent results.</p><p>- As for another woman in your situation who was going to get pregnant again, I would highly suggest talking to their doctor about testing A1c in early pregnancy, as this has shown to be a very strong prediction of GD (98.4%) and macrosomia. You could also consider using a glucometer to get a better understanding of how different foods impact your blood sugar levels.</p><p>“And further... IF that could even be the case, should I be watching Orlo's carb intake?“</p><p>- I completely agree with what Erica said. We don’t want to limit a baby/toddlers carbohydrate intake, but rather try to ensure that his food intake is balanced. Like with pregnancy, carbohydrates are important, but it’s best if they’re low glycemic and ‘part’ of a balanced meal—being mindful to include protein and healthy fats as well. This is covered more thoroughly in foundational nutrition!</p>]]></message>

<message><![CDATA[<p>Funny enough, this was just added to the learning content...</p><p>"Protein requirements in pregnancy: Protein will be more thoroughly discussed in Foundational Nutrition, but this macronutrient deserves to be addressed in this module as well. Considering that the amino acids of protein are the building blocks of muscle, tissue, bones, cartilage, skin, hair, and nails, it’s no wonder that they would be an important consideration when growing a baby from scratch. Protein is not only required for fetal growth, but also for the placenta and maternal tissues, such as skin, uterine, and breast."</p><p>I don't usually discuss exact grams (as there actually hasn’t been much research in regards to actual protein requirements during pregnancy), but needs do increase significantly, so I do focus on its importance. Most sources suggest a range of 40-70g/day. However, the best study to date says that this should be more: 79 g/d up to 16 wks, and 108 g/d after 36 wks. You've inspired me to add this to the learning material ;)</p>]]></message>

<message><![CDATA[<p>Ok awesome, thanks again Carley!<br>On the same topic..what about protein needs for babies? Just guessing here but I would think encouraging parents to include protein with meals and trying to balance meals for their babies as well would be best practice. Is that typically what you recommend? Do you ever discuss daily protein recommendations for babies with clients?</p>]]></message>

<message><![CDATA[<p>Yes, I really encourage offering a variety of foods, including protein. Especially with self-fed babies as parents are often more likely to blend higher protein foods into purees rather than giving them as finger foods. I feel like this becomes more important for toddlers, but protein (and balanced macronutrients) is needed for babies too. This becomes even more paramount for anyone who chooses to raise their baby as vegan because many of the plant-based sources of protein aren't particularly the best options for babies. I'm also updating the learning content in this regard and will add a lesson specifically on supporting a vegan baby and potential risks.</p>]]></message>

<message><![CDATA[<p>Regarding Pelvic Floor Dysfunction: What about Prolapse? I'm curious if there are any suggested protocols to potentially help.  Would the herbal sitz bath (same ingredients in module 1) help? What about the Loose Skin protocols?  I'm also curious that if these protocols are indeed beneficial, would they only be in the first few weeks/immediately, or potentially months down the line. Say 6 months? Full transparency, I've been dealing with this. Long story short: I started Pelvic Floor Therapy 1.5 months after birth, prolapse developed in 2nd month. I continue with PF Therapy for a total of 3 months. Only when I started acupuncture/chinese herbs did I start to see a mild reduction. Still, I think there might be more I could be doing..? Hoping so.  Would love any nutrition or more holistic concepts to consider. Thanks!</p>]]></message>

<message><![CDATA[<p>Lots of reputable brands sell them. It's actually much more difficult to source vitamins, as you have to consider if they're synthetic, methylated (B vitamins), co-factors, etc. However, adaptogens are usually just single sourced, minimal processing (dried or made into a tincture), and rarely produced with pesticides as they're often quite hardy (such as a root). Although, seeking out an organic brand for good measure is always good practice when possible!</p>]]></message>

<message><![CDATA[<p>Like all bodily functions, producing breast milk and breastfeeding does expend energy (calories). The exact amount varies depending on how frequently a mother breastfeeds, how much breast milk she's producing/how much baby consumes. On average, the body expends approximately 500 calories per day when exclusively breastfeeding. Although, weight loss is not always the result as breastfeeding usually substantially increases appetite. And we always want to encourage new mothers to follow the hunger cues, focusing on nutrient-dense foods when possible.</p>]]></message>

<message><![CDATA[<p>Okay. Thrush. What are your thoughts on caprylic acid? Are herbal anticandidal diets counter to nursing..? I would imagine so. Is there a balm that is proactive from the start? So lets be proactive rather than reactive if its easy enough to do? I used coconut alllllllll the time internally and on my nipples. I do not know if it was proactive, or luck to not have had thrush.</p>]]></message>

<message><![CDATA[<p>I am still nursing my boys (5 yrs and 3yrs) and feel as if everyone in the mix is working on weaning...my breast tissue has been tender (as well as my nipples) and I am wondering if during weaning, this is normal? Would curcumin be a good topical for me possibly? I hope you don't mind the personal "I am your client" discussion! Long term nursing is a whole other topic...one that has very unique facets and obstacles and hormonal complications so-to-say. When I attempted to wean last summer, hormonally/emotionally it was so crazy for me and the boys. This is an area where I don't see much support, but instead judgement. That certainly doesn't assist this edge of postpartum with comfort or satisfaction.</p>]]></message>

<message><![CDATA[<p>I hear that!! Whenever I've posted anything on social media about the hormonal/emotional components associated with weaning and how under discussed and supported this is, so many mothers are so relieved to have someone finally acknowledge it. There's a lesson in module 4 about this that I think you'll like! The majority of breast sensitivity associated with weaning is due to engorgement, but it can be hormonally relayed as well. There are more suggestions in the aforementioned lesson, which may be applicable depending on where you are in your weaning journey. Wishing you all the best through this transition... all three of you!</p>]]></message>

<message><![CDATA[<p>This gets a bit tricky. Caprylic acid generally isn't recommended during pregnancy/breastfeeding as it's known to cause a ‘die-off’ of yeast, which can release toxins into the bloodstream. As far as herbs to treat candida, they aren't often recommended during breastfeeding. While an anticandidal diet could be very beneficial for thrush, going too low carb can also reduce breast milk supply - so it's a balance. Obviously reducing sugar and refined carbs would be great though.</p>]]></message>

<message><![CDATA[<p>The primary reason that many multivitamins have lower levels of calcium is because people often tend to consume more dietary calcium, and as such, require less though supplementation. Generally, the amount of calcium found in a multivitamin would be enough to reduce the absorption of iron. Therefore, if iron is a of particular concern (anemia), it's recommended to take additional supplementation (or consume iron-rich foods) away from a multivitamin containing calcium and calcium-rich meals.</p>]]></message>

<message><![CDATA[<p>This is called induced lactation. It may be possible, and most typically done with prescribed hormone therapy. You can read more bout it here: <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/healthy-lifestyle/infant-and-toddler-health/expert-answers/induced-lactation/faq-20058403" rel="nofollow noopener" title="https://www.mayoclinic.org/healthy-lifestyle/infant-and-toddler-health/expert-answers/induced-lactation/faq-20058403">https://www.mayoclinic.org/...</a>. There's also something called the Newman-Goldfarb Inducing lactation protocol. As for the elderly Chinese grandmother, I can't say for sure as I'm not familiar with the story, but she may have been a wet nurse. It is possible to continue lactation, even past menopause, if suckling/stimulation continue with regularity.</p>]]></message>

<message><![CDATA[<p>There's both preformed vitamin A and beta-carotene to ensure a baby gets exactly what they need. Preformed vitamin A is the most stable and reliable form of this nutrient, but the beta-carotene is there as a 'top up' when needed. If the baby has had sufficient vitamin A intake, the water-soluble beta-carotene will be excreted, but if it's needed, it will convert. Conversion rates are less reliable though and vary from person to person, which is why the preformed vitamin A is present.</p>]]></message>

<message><![CDATA[<p>Ohh I’ve never listened to this episode but I don’t love the sounds of it to be honest. DHA supplementation is very important in the postpartum period, for both mother and baby. There is so much research to support the use of fish oil during lactation and it feels like perilous advice to suggest otherwise. I haven’t seen anything to support it’s purported lactation suppressing properties (did Dr. Brooke reference anything?). But I have seen countless studies on how fish oil supplementation can greatly improve the fatty acid composition of breast milk.</p><p>As for turmeric, this has been traditionally used as a galactagogue to increase breast milk supply for ages. While it has been used topically to receive engorgement, this is used more for its anti-inflammatory properties. The only link I’ve seen to reducing prolactin is in murine studies as a therapy for prolactinoma, which is a tumor of the pituitary gland that causes an increased level of prolactin. It’s been shown that curcumin (the extracted active component of turmeric) can then decrease the production and release of prolactin in rats with prolactinoma. I wouldn’t be ready to make the leap that the culinary use of turmeric suppresses lactation in humans without prolactinoma. That said, as with all things… everyone responds differently, so mothers should be aware of that.</p><p>Just my two cents ;)</p>]]></message>

<message><![CDATA[<p>Hi Nina, another student actually asked the same question in module 4. This was my reply...<br>"As for turmeric, this has been traditionally used as a galactagogue to increase breast milk supply for ages. While it has also been used topically to receive engorgement, this is used more for its anti-inflammatory properties. The only link I’ve seen to reducing prolactin is in murine studies as a therapy for prolactinoma, which is a tumor of the pituitary gland that causes an increased level of prolactin. It’s been shown that curcumin (the extracted active component of turmeric) can then decrease the production and release of prolactin in rats with prolactinoma. I wouldn’t be ready to make the leap that the culinary use of turmeric suppresses lactation in humans without prolactinoma. That said, as with all things… everyone responds differently, so mothers should be aware of that. Just my two cents ;)"</p>]]></message>

<message><![CDATA[<p>Hi Amanda, is this something that developed during pregnancy? As a general rule, it's best to take medication away from any supplementation. Her iron levels should have been tested in early pregnancy, so it (hopefully) would have been brought to her attention if levels were low. Thyroid dysfunction is discussed at greater length during the Postpartum course. I'm emailing you the lesson to see further recommendations.</p>]]></message>

<message><![CDATA[<p>Hi Ulike, I don't have anything written down to share. But I usually dig deeper by inquiring more about the client's potential symptoms — because lab results AND symptoms matter. So if they are on the low end of normal, I'll ask questions to see if this could be causing any specific symptoms rated to certain conditions or deficiencies. Often this range (low end of normal) can use more specific support, especially when it comes to something such as the thyroid.</p>]]></message>

<message><![CDATA[<p>PCOS is a really big conversation. It comes up a lot in relation to fertility as it can make conceiving very difficult. In terms of postpartum it's seen as a 'preexisting condition' so not something that's necessarily within the scope of a postpartum nutrition consultant (but it will be thoroughly covered  in the future OBA fertility course!). As for low supply, this happens due to the disrupted hormones levels PCOS causes. Recommendations would be the same as found in the 'Naturally Increasing Milk Supply' but I would also highly suggest any efforts that could be made to help balance blood sugar as PCOS greatly impacts insulin. These are discussed in greater depth in foundational nutrition and pregnancy (for gestational diabetes). Some really broad-strokes recommendations would be: <br>- Reduce refined sugars<br>- Reduce processed “white” carbohydrates in favor of whole carbs such as root veg etc.<br>- Reduce higher glycemic foods<br>- Balance meals with more more protein, healthy fats and fiber.</p>]]></message>

<message><![CDATA[<p>This could be a possible contributor to her constipation. If she's set on this prenatal, you could suggest all other recommendations in the constipation protocol (module 3) and see if that's enough to resolve it. Otherwise, switching to a brand with a more gentle form of iron may be best for her. She could always save the bottle and try it again during postpartum (if expiry allows).</p>]]></message>

<message><![CDATA[<p>Naturelo Prenatal lists it's vitamin A as being from beta-carotene, which is sourced from D. salina (Dunaliella salina, a micro-algea). It contains 1040 mcg RAE, which is a newer form of nutrient measurement that accounts for the amount of vitamin A available to the body after beta-carotene converts into active vitamin A. The RDA during pregnancy is 750 mcg RAE. I'll be updating the curriculum with this new form of measurement and conversion.</p>]]></message>

<message><![CDATA[<p>Just that it's generally too salty for babies. While fermented foods do contain salt, they have the added benefits of introducing the sour flavor and beneficial bacteria. Plus, such small amounts are consumed. With dairy, I prefer starting with goats yogurt, then cows as they're much lower in sodium. Cheese seems to be popular in the BLW circles, but they sodium is just too high in my opinion. As for safety (types of cheese etc.), the same recommendations would apply for women during pregnancy.</p>]]></message>

<message><![CDATA[<p>Hi Nina, this isn't something that's commonly tested for, it would be quite rare actually. It could be more likely to happen for someone on a plan-based diet who isn't consuming complete proteins (with all essential amino acids). Or someone who doesn't vary their protein source often and is therefore consuming foods that are high levels of some amino acids, but low in others. It may also be more likely in someone with poor digestion, or someone taking antacids regularly. Both of these may cause deficiencies in things other than just amino acids as well though. The best defense against this is really to eat as varied a diet as possible. As I said, it's not something that is often tested for, but I would refer out to a naturopath is this is something that a client wanted to explore. If you'd like to read more about this, these articles share more: <a href="https://www.psychologytoday.com/ca/blog/answers-appetite/201406/amino-acids-why-don-t-i-have-enough" rel="nofollow noopener" title="https://www.psychologytoday.com/ca/blog/answers-appetite/201406/amino-acids-why-don-t-i-have-enough">https://www.psychologytoday...</a> and <a href="http://www.aminomics.com/sometimes-deficient-amino-acids/" rel="nofollow noopener" title="http://www.aminomics.com/sometimes-deficient-amino-acids/">http://www.aminomics.com/so...</a> (word of caution, the last link is a company that is selling a product in relation to amino acids).</p>]]></message>

<message><![CDATA[<p>When it comes to severe pain/nipple damage, I always recommend referring out to a lactation consultant. I completely understand that a frenotomy may feel like the best solution for a mother in the end, and I would never try to make anyone feel like they have made the wrong choice for themselves or their baby! It's just not something that I promote in my own practice. I recognize that it's highly personal decision and often made by mothers who feel as though it's their only solution.</p>]]></message>

<message><![CDATA[<p>While studies have not been conducted on the use of adaptogens while<br>breastfeeding, many adaptogens have long history of safe use in<br>traditional cultures. The use of adaptogens while breastfeeding is<br>commonly promoted by modern herbalists as well. The one known exception is Panex Ginseng (also called Asian and Korean ginseng), which is not recommended to use when breastfeeding. The use of adaptogens is not recommended during pregnancy, but several are known for being beneficial in supporting fertility — specifically maca and rhodiola.</p>]]></message>

<message><![CDATA[<p>Ph goodness... just realized that I never got back to you about this! Unfortunately, the research in this area is dreadfully lacking.</p><p>The same is true for pregnancy, in which the curriculum states "Surprisingly, current recommendations are not as evidence-based as women may have been lead to believe. This is because, until recently, there hasn’t been much research done on protein requirements during pregnancy, and previous recommendations were primarily based on the requirements of non-pregnant women." The current RDA for a non-pregnant/non-lactating woman is 50 grams, during pregnancy it is 60 grams, and during lactation it is 65 grams (1st 6 months) and 62 grams (2nd 6 months).</p><p>That said, we discussed how the actual requirements may look more like 83-103 during pregnancy, so the needs in postpartum are very likely much higher as well. That said, caloric needs are higher too, and the majority of women experience an increase in hunger. Consuming more foods = more of a chance to consume protein, so there's no need to slam protein shakes by any means. Carbohydrate rich foods can be very comforting during postpartum, but balancing that with protein also helps to increase satiation, balance blood sugar, and regulate hormones. All beneficial qualities for a postpartum mama!</p>]]></message>

<message><![CDATA[<p>Yes, microwaves often heat food unevenly, with the hottest area being in the center wile the coolest places being on the outside. This could lead parents/caregivers to believe that baby's food is not too hot (when it is). If a microwave is part of a family's household, some may feel comfortable using one for baby's food while taking certain precautions. Others choose to avoid microwaves all together due to the radiation, however, that's yet to have been scientifically linked to health concerns.</p>]]></message>

<message><![CDATA[<p>I've yet to hear of a baby experiencing discomfort due to the inclusion of fat. Remember that breast milk contains fat as well, so they are used to digesting it. However, only a little is needed in baby's foods. That said, while many people experience tummy upset after eating fried foods made from industrial seed oils (canola oil, etc), if discomfort is experienced after healthy fats, such as olive oil or ghee, it may be a sign of the body needing support. Is it associated with abdominal cramping, bloating, excess gas, or "greasy" stools? Is the sensation in the center or right side? It could be related to the pancreas or gallbladder. You could try digestive enzymes that help breakdown fat, like lipase and pancreatin. Just a start!</p>]]></message>

<message><![CDATA[<p>Hi Mikal, Choline is a precursor to the neurotransmitter acetylcholine (or L-choline). The body uses choline to make acetylcholine. While it may seem to make sense to skip the choline bitrate and go straight to the acetylcholine, the fact of the matter is that we really don't have the data to support proper dose recommendations for acetylcholine during pregnancy. As they would likely be different than those for choline bitartrate.</p><p>The body also needs choline to synthesize phosphatidyl choline. While phosphatidyl choline supplements also provide choline; choline comprises only about 13% of the weight of phosphatidylcholine.</p><p>It probably sounds unnecessarily confusing, but the bottom line is that we're not as confident as to how those forms would support pregnancy. I was able to find other choline bitrate on iherb though. Would you have access to this? <a href="https://ca.iherb.com/pr/Country-Life-Choline-100-Tablets/1631" rel="nofollow noopener" title="https://ca.iherb.com/pr/Country-Life-Choline-100-Tablets/1631">https://ca.iherb.com/pr/Cou...</a> or this <a href="https://ca.iherb.com/pr/Advance-Physician-Formulas-Choline-Bitartrate-650-mg-60-Capsules/54565" rel="nofollow noopener" title="https://ca.iherb.com/pr/Advance-Physician-Formulas-Choline-Bitartrate-650-mg-60-Capsules/54565">https://ca.iherb.com/pr/Adv...</a></p>]]></message>

I see now that you asked this on a previous thread, but it seems as though it got buried on my end.</p><p>Oh goodness, you're right... I didn't mention Vitamin A after saying that I would! The unit of measurements was recently changed in regards to vitamin A (which is not measured in RAE). As such, we're working with our research team to ensure that we have the proper recommendations that align with these new measurements. We promise that you'll have access to this as soon as it's complete. As for your client trials, there's no need to mention amounts it in your submission. Please just highlight the important of this nutrient and how you encouraged your participant to include vitamin A rich foods in her diet. Thanks for your understanding.</p>]]></message>

<message><![CDATA[<p>Yes, that really would be ideal. However, I have found that this can cause stress for some mothers. Especially those who don't have a large freezer stash and often just need to use what's available when it's available. I tend to suggest it as a something that they might consider if it's available to them. Remembering that formula obviously remains the same at all times.</p>]]></message>

<message><![CDATA[<p>I find the coughing &amp; frequent throat clearing symptoms (of an allergic reaction) to be tricky. My son has/had reflux and sometimes clears his throat a bunch, even before starting solids. He started clearing his throat a lot when his spitting up subsided.  He used to spit up all the time. Now, he spits up after every feeding. But it’s not the whole meal, and he’s never bothered by it. He used to be much more bothered when he was very little and it was a common occurrence.  We had to hold him upright to sleep, or put him on an inclined mattress. We were told that would disappear as he matured and his esophageal sphincter closed. I believe we have witnessed this happen. Although I would say he spits up 75% less of the time, it’s hard for me to tell if it’s completely gone away and is just “normal baby spit up.” I do find that at every growth spurt, he might spit up a bit more for a few days. Regardless, I’m curious if his throat clearing is connected to him swallowing what would otherwise be spit up. He now burps and swallows, when he used to burp and everything would flow out of his mouth. I do not notice any particular throat clearing after eating food, it's just random throughout the day, however maybe I should start a journal.</p><p>Thoughts on this scenario?</p><p>I also find irritability, difficulty sleeping &amp; restlessness tricky as well. I do feel like at the beginning of a growth spurt this happens to our son. He needs more holding, or to be picked up more at night. He might wake up to burp, however he has not been burping often after breastfeeding or side lying in the middle of the night. So 1 hr later, he fusses, we pick him up to burp him &amp; then he falls back asleep.</p><p>I don’t want to become paranoid, but I also don’t want to miss anything or be negligent out of my desire for everything to be ok.</p><p>Would love your take!</p>]]></message>

<message><![CDATA[<p>Hi Hannah, you don't sound paranoid at all! It sounds like you and your little love have been dealing with a lot and I imagine it must be exhausting. It also sounds as though you're being very thoughtful and supportive. When I say 'coughing &amp; frequent throat clearing' this is more related to mucus, so similar to constant cold symptoms. It would be more phlegm, whereas you son seems to be related to his reflux. As for  'irritability, difficulty sleeping &amp; restlessness' this would be when it's unrelated to other identifiable causes. In this case (growth spurt), or in the case of something like teething, you know the cause. That said, food sensitivities are known to be a potential triggered for reflux. Have you tried an elimination diet on yourself? And have you introduced the top allergens to your son as of yet to monitor his response? (Details are in module 4)</p>]]></message>

<message><![CDATA[<p>Hey Kayla. Thanks for your patience with my reply. These numbers are the range used to calculate the mean. In this study you can see that the mean is the mid-point of that range.</p><p>Example 1: 2885 pg/mL [95% CI, 1624-4146]  (2885 is the mean of 1624-4146)<br>Example 2: 1340 pg/mL [95% CI, 978-1702]  (1340 is the mean of 978-1702)</p><p>And yes, we're working on a lesson to help you properly assess studies with examples to help you put these numbers into context! :)</p>]]></message>

<message><![CDATA[<p>It would just mean that iron (with vitamin C rich foods) should become even more of a focus when solids are introduced. Generally speaking, iron supplementation is not advised. But if baby has not reached readiness signs as they approach 7 months, I would suggest they request a blood test for hemoglobin to determine baby's needs. Iron stores usually start to decline after 6 months, but it's not as drastic as "one day they're ok, then the next they're non-existent". As long as iron is a focus with first foods, this usually isn't a concern.</p>]]></message>

<message><![CDATA[<p>Cruciferous vegetables are known to cause gas as they contain a certain type of carbohydrate that is not digestible by humans, but it does feed our beneficial bacteria. This can cause bloating, but it's not harmful and it's different than inflammation, which is the immune system way of healing and repairing damaged tissue. Acute inflammation is normal and welcomed, however, chronic inflammation is when the immune system is overactive. The resulting heightened white cell activity can lead to lowered immunity and other health complications.</p>]]></message>

<message><![CDATA[<p>In my practice, I alway recommend sealing the eczema with a pharmaceutical-grade lanolin. When doing this I've never seen anyone react poorly to the coconut oil. The reason I prefer coconut oil for this purpose is that it absorbs more quickly and allows the lanolin to 'stick' better. It would be more difficult to put lanolin over a more 'oily' oil. However, if you're using an oil after a swim/bath without using lanolin over the eczema patch right away, a shea butter or almond oil would be wonderful. That said, while I haven't seem any negative reactions, as with most things, everyone can respond differently. So it's best to advise parents to monitor their children and adapt our recommendations as needed ;)</p>]]></message>

<message><![CDATA[<p>Ultimately, this would be ideal. However, I've found that this is sometimes dependent on the mother. As a young baby often eats very little (in comparison to an adult) and their diet is quite simple, usually removing something like wheat (for example) would be more simple than removing it from a mother's diet who consumes wheat products on a regular basis. In this case, you have to think about if the level of difficulty might cause the mother to give up on the elimination diet all together, or perhaps stop breastfeeding. While this may be one end of the spectrum, it's very real for some mothers and something we have to consider. In some cases, when I know it would be very difficult for the mother, I suggest starting with the baby. Then if there is some improvement (but not full recovery) I suggest that she do the same elimination in her own diet as well.</p>]]></message>

<message><![CDATA[<p>I've always been in support of fennel for babies, however a student brought the previously linked study to my attention during our last intake. As such, I changed my recommendation to 'not advised for the time being' while we did a further deep dive into the research. Fennel is widely used by both babies and breastfeeding mothers without many known adverse reactions. While the study referenced 2 cases where there were temporary adverse reactions from fennel, I've also learned that sometimes (on rare occasions) Japanese star anise has been substituted for fennel. As this is toxic, it can cause complications. However, this is not due to fennel being problematic, but rather due to mislabeling. As such, we've reverted our recommendations back to being in favor of fennel, both for constipation in babies and breastfeeding blends (such as the product you linked).</p>]]></message>

<message><![CDATA[<p>5-10 mcg is actually just the minimum. Most supplements contain more than this and it's okay to take more as it's a water-soluble nutrient and the body will excrete what it doesn't need. However, excess B12 can cause dark yellow urine. Not harmful, but sometimes helpful to warn clients about this ;)</p>]]></message>

<message><![CDATA[<p>Hi Carley, I have a volunteer client that has been offering their baby white bread (not toasted, just raw pieces) and the baby coughs a lot when eating. I assume from the texture of a fluffy white bread that it wouldn't be a great texture for a baby. If they want to continue to offer this to their baby, would toasted or a harder bread like sourdough (without crusts) be better? (Just want to get my options sorted before consult!) Thanks.</p>]]></message>

<message><![CDATA[<p>It's problematic for a few reasons. First being that white bread can gels and clump up when moistened with saliva. I'd worry about that forming into a ball and becoming a potential chocking hazard. Secondly, it's really lacking the nutrients that babies require at this age. We really don't want to fill their bellies up with things that are going to displace more nutrient dense food. When working with this client you can ask some probing questions to better understand 'why' they're choosing white bread. Is it convenience? Baby likes it? Lack of other ideas/options? I know you're thoughtful and will be able to support this mother without seeming judgemental.</p>]]></message>

<message><![CDATA[<p>Hi Kate, yes it is advised to supplement both mother and baby after a cesarean birth. As for dosage, most baby probiotics are around 1-4 billion CFU. I recommend starting slow with babies as their digestive system will require time to adjust to the new probiotic strains. Too much too soon may cause gas and bloating.</p>]]></message>

<message><![CDATA[<p>Hi Mikal, we prefer sticking with this age range as so much of the information to share is primarily relevant before or while starting solids. 7 months is the oldest that would be appropriate for this client trial. If you're really struggling, I suggest posting on our OBA facebook group to see if another student may know of an additional volunteer. And of course, posting on your own personal social channels as well. Someone you know may be able to connect you with a volunteer.</p>]]></message>

<message><![CDATA[<p>Hi Carley, my one client has a 4 month old who was born 3 weeks early. Interestingly, her Doctor had suggested she start solids anytime now without any reasoning behind it. I recommended strongly that she wait until the 6 month point which she agreed felt right to her. However, she asked that since her baby was born 3 weeks early, should she wait an additional 3 weeks before starting, or is she okay start at 6 months after babies birth as long as baby is showing all signs of developmental readiness?</p>]]></message>

<message><![CDATA[<p>So glad to hear that your suggestions felt right and resonated with this client! This is from the curriculum: A note about premature babies<br>Most babies born prematurely need extra time before they are truly developmentally ready to start solids. It’s often advised to go by their corrected (or adjusted) age, but the needs of each premature baby varies greatly. It’s best that parents watch for the developmental signs of readiness to help them make a decision that suits their little one.</p>]]></message>

<message><![CDATA[<p>Hi Carley! You mention not to season baby's food with salt, however, do you mean no salt while cooking as well? In thinking about family foods, and making a whole chicken for the family to share, I'm wondering if you still recommend no salt in the seasoning rub.  I realize salt can be constipating. Is there a time when you think it's introduction (in small and reasonable amounts), is ok?</p>]]></message>

<message><![CDATA[<p>Hi, yes it’s best to avoid salt for babies under 1 and minimize it for children at least until 2, as it’s difficult on their kidneys. For family cooking I recommend adding salt for adults afterwards. Although when it comes to chicken rubs, I would still feed the meat to baby. Opt for the inner portions and don’t offer them the skin. More salty crispy skin for you ;)</p>]]></message>

<message><![CDATA[<p>Hi Carley, my client with the 4 month old has mentioned in her intake form that her husband has a peanut allergy. Not severe, but he avoids eating them and they can keep them in the house as her older daughter eats peanut butter regularly. Her first daughter experienced no issues with peanut introduction. There is no asthma or eczema in the family so my first instinct is to say that her baby would not be considered high risk, but that she may want to consider speaking with her doctor before introducing peanuts specifically, and proceeding with the rest of the top allergenic foods based on the introduction timeline. Am I on the right track here? Or, based on this from the curriculum "“The early introduction of peanuts significantly decreased the frequency of<br>the development of peanut allergy among children at high risk for this<br>allergy and modulated immune responses to peanuts.”</p><p>should I be recommending that she do the introduction of peanuts at 6 months, keep an antihistamine on hand and monitor closely for reaction?</p><p>I just want to make sure I'm making the best, safest recommendation for her daughter.</p><p>Thank you!</p>]]></message>

<message><![CDATA[<p>Hi Carley,</p><p>My client has introduced egg yolk with no reaction, however egg whites caused skin rash reaction. Eggs baked into a muffin caused vomiting 4-5 hours after consumption (though mixed with other ingredients so uncertain if egg is the culprit, just the mother's description and her intuition). The baby has eczema and will do the elimination protocol (as has intro'd dairy, so will do it for that), however I have assumed they should do it with egg as well (both yolk, then white, then together). Would that be the best thing to do? Elimination protocol with dairy and eggs being avoided, intro dairy first (if no reaction then intro yolk, if no reaction, intro whites and so on)?</p>]]></message>

<message><![CDATA[<p>Vomiting after egg whites is a common reaction, so I would be inclined to guess that's what it was from. Your recommendation of an elimination protocol sounds appropriate. You can see if this family would prefer doing both dairy and eggs at the same time, or if they'd rather do a single elimination for both. Just to note, babies who respond to egg whites in that way typically grow out of this, so depending on the results of the elimination protocol this baby may not need to avoid eggs long term. Especially if working on gut/immune support at the same time.</p><p>So wonderful that you're able to support them through this!</p>]]></message>

<message><![CDATA[<p>I would start with dairy. Is the husband against giving it a try? It could be linked, or it may be separate. Really hard to guess without doing an elimination. Yes, in this case you'd monitor for changes in all symptoms. Removing milk may help with one or all of these concerns. If only one improves, then add another potential trigger to test through elimination. As always, continue with the other steps outlined in the protocol.</p>]]></message>

<message><![CDATA[<p>Great, thank you! That makes sense. The husband is very skeptical that dairy causes any type of reaction in anyone. He was raised on it, and has always consumed it. I explained to my client that if we do remove it and they seem improvements in their sons health, its tough to argue with that. I've also shared some of the links to studies from the curriculum with her.</p>]]></message>

<message><![CDATA[<p>Hi Carley, my client (starting solids soon) gave up dairy when their baby was 2 months old because the baby was experiencing excess spit up, baby acne and gassiness. Since giving up dairy the baby has gotten better. The client wants to reintroduce dairy for herself but unsure how to do so due to the baby's previous symptoms and not wanting them to return. It has been 3.5 months that the client has avoided dairy. Would you suggest a reintro, for the mother (like the healing protocol for sensitivities and eczema) and then wait and see if there's any reaction in the baby? From our postpartum notes, there is mention of the mother to avoid dairy and to take Lactobacillus reuteri. Would this be a concurrent suggestion to trialling a reintro of dairy, or recommend the probiotic for a period of time and after such a period then trying dairy again. (Baby is exclusively breastfed). <br>Hope that makes sense, thanks!</p>]]></message>

<message><![CDATA[<p>Hi Anja, not a problem I'm glad you reached out. That's what this board is here for. If B9 is naturally sourced from lemon peel, then it should be folate and wouldn't be synthetic. However, if the label lists that it's 'folic acid' that would mean that it is synthetic—so it doesn't quite match up. Do you have a link for the product in question? I can take a better look and let you know what I think.</p>]]></message>

<message><![CDATA[<p>Hi Mikal. In this case, the mother could simply reintroduce dairy in her diet and see how the baby responds. She could definitely take a probiotic as well. However, I'm wondering if this baby is starting solids soon? If so, they could wait a little while longer and do the trial with the baby. It quite a bit easier to watch for symptoms directly as opposed to monitoring for a reaction through breast milk. If the baby reacts, then it's best for the mother to continue avoiding herself while breastfeeding as well.</p>]]></message>

<message><![CDATA[<p>Of course, so sorry!! I just read everything with Google translate. In case you're curious here is a translated description:</p><p>Folic acid belongs to the group of B vitamins. It plays a role in all growth and development processes, especially in the formation of blood, cells and genetic material. It is therefore particularly important during pregnancy. It is recommended to take folic acid 1 month before and at least 3 months after fertilization.</p><p>Each tablet of GSE Folic Acid Compact contains 400 μg folic acid. This is 200% of the recommended daily intake according to VO (EG) 1196/2011 on the nutrition labeling of foods. The European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) recommends 400 μg folic acid for women who want to have children and who are pregnant. One tablet per day already covers this recommendation.</p><p>Only ingredients from organic cultivation are used for Folic Acid Compact and like the entire Phyto Vitamins product range, Folic Acid Compact contains only vitamins that are obtained directly from plants and standardized. In addition to the naturally occurring vitamins, the organic plant extract used also contains the secondary plant substances that naturally occur in the plant. These plant-based substances also support the usability of natural folic acid.</p><p>GSE Folic Acid Compact - biological and bioactive; just as nature intended.</p>]]></message>

<message><![CDATA[<p>No need to apologize at all. This s honestly an interesting instance. Ana says (and I agree) "It does look like they use the terms 'folsäure' (folic acid) and 'folat' (folate) interchangeably here. This product in particular is very vague and doesn't specify whether it's methylated, just says it contains 'natural folic acid'."</p><p>By the way they present it, it does seem as though it's folate derived from natural sources. Although the only way to be 100% certain would be to contact the company and ask if that's the case, or if they've also included any folic acid from synthetic sources.</p>]]></message>

<message><![CDATA[<p>Hi! loving this weeks materials, so informative. <br>I had a few questions  - sorry if some of these are loaded questions...<br>- In the once a day vitamin material, there was a note to check for artificial dyes + harmful ingredients, supplement labels can be confusing even at the best of times, is there a list of a few of them to look out for? <br>- I've noticed that a few more prenatal vitamins are including folinic acid as well as folic acid - what's your take on folinic acid?<br>- In one of the choline studies (<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2782876/)" rel="nofollow noopener" title="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2782876/)">https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.go...</a> its mentioned that choline is needed for methyl-group metabolism. I could be interpreting this incorrectly, but could this mean that it helps in the conversion of folic acid to folate? further to this, say a client has (with all best intentions) bought a supplement with folic acid, as they can be pricey, may not want to switch to a new supplement, and it was recommended not to supplement further with folate if on folic acid, could a choline supplement essentially "act" as folate?<br>- Vit B12 is deemed mandatory for plant-based diets, I've heard of more research that says that even animal based diets are deficient (if not slightly more deficient) than plant-based diets, should B12 supplementation be recommended for everyone?</p>]]></message>

<message><![CDATA[<p>Hi Jelena, so great to hear that you've enjoyed the first week so far! My replies...</p><p><b>Supplement labels</b><br>This is covered in greater length in Foundational Nutrition. We placed this information here so that it was accessible by all students, regardless of which course they were enrolled in.</p><p><b>Folinic acid</b><br>Yes this is good quality and would be recommended. You can find out a little more about that here: <a href="https://seekinghealth.org/resource/methylfolate-vs-folinic-acid/?fref=gc" rel="nofollow noopener" title="https://seekinghealth.org/resource/methylfolate-vs-folinic-acid/?fref=gc">https://seekinghealth.org/r...</a></p><p><b>Choline study </b><br>While choline is highly interrelated with folate and can indeed help its function, it wouldn’t quite take its place. Choline does assist with methylation, this is most valuable in the body with the conversion of folate (food sources or supplements) &gt; a methylated folate. <br>If someone has a supplement with folic acid and prefers not to discontinue their use, I’d suggest saving them until they were in later stages of pregnancy as high quality B9 is most important in the first trimester. Additionally, they could buy another bottle and alternate between the brands each day.</p><p><b>Vit B12</b> <br>Studies show that those on a strictly plant-based diet become deficient in B12. Whereas, anyone eating animal proteins OR supplementing on a regular basis would be getting sufficient intake of B12. The reason why studies have shown that those on a plant-based diet that supplement/eat fortified foods have higher serum concentrations than those who eat meat and don’t supplement is because supplements provide (on average) 1000 - 2500 mcg. This obviously increases B12 serum levels, but the body only absorbs what it needs and excretes the rest. Although omnivore can have lower serum concentrations, they aren’t often <i>*deficient*</i> (from what I’ve seen, would be happy to look over different studies you have), they just don’t have unnecessarily high serum levels due to excessive supplementation (comparatively). That said, all prenatal multivitamins should contain B12, so everyone (regardless of diet) will be meeting needs there. While someone could supplement with B12 in addition to that, as other nutrients/supplements are higher priority, I don’t think this is necessary. This may need to be reconsidered if a client: has poor absorption, took hormonal birth control, or consumes antacids or other certain medication that may interfere with absorption.</p><p>Hope that helps!</p>]]></message>

<message><![CDATA[<p>Hi Suzanne...</p><p><b>"Can the recommended 27 mg/day of iron cause constipation?"</b> It's possible, some types can. But the types we recommend are the more gentle forms and are MUCH less likely to lead to constipation.</p><p><b>"If a client was eating meat 3x a week would she need to supplement with iron?"</b><br>We're looking for 27 mg/day. You can look at the list of food sources and do a little math to see what food sources would bring the daily total up to. I don't like turning diet into a math equation, but doing this can help to show you how much diet is contributing to total intake. As an example, 2.5 oz of beef = 1.4-3.3 mgs, so that alone would require additional supplementation. Also note that most all prenatal multivitamins contain iron as well.</p><p><b>"And if so how much is too much, leading to constipation?"</b><br>This is individual for each person, and steps in the constipation protocol can be utilized for a sensitive client. However, non-heme (vegetarian) forms don't build up in the body in the same way, so it wouldn't be a concern of getting 'too much'.</p>]]></message>

<message><![CDATA[<p>Hey Emma! In this case you would just follow through with the healing protocol. While identifying the trigger food is beneficial, the protocol is the most important part of the process. In this way, we could seal and support the gut to hopefully prevent any patches from returning. However, you should still provide her with the elimination diet so if the patches do reappear at some point, she can try to identify it/them at that time. In your write up you can say "as recommended by Carley" so the evaluator knows that I suggested this for you and your client.</p>]]></message>

<message><![CDATA[<p>Hi Carley,<br>I am not feeling that I would be very confident in recommending and advising on adaptogen use beyond recommending one that may be suitable and helpful for clients. I’m also seeing very different concentrations and recommended daily doses available for many of the ones covered in this module. Is there somewhere that you can point me to familiarize myself with what a good protocol would look like for these? I’m also thinking about the length of time in which one would use these as long term use is not advised. What length of time would be advisable and if needing to repeat use of them, how soon after stopping could one safely resume? Any more information you have would be greatly appreciated! Thank you,<br>Emily</p>]]></message>

While it's popular for fertility, and rebalancing postpartum, there is currently no research on its use during pregnancy. As such, any potential adverse side effects or birth outcomes are unknown. Most practitioners advise against supplementing with it for that reason. We dive deep into adaptogens in module 3 postpartum!</p>]]></message>

<message><![CDATA[<p>Hi Emily, this thread in particular was created with a question for adaptogens to support fertility. I’m assuming your questions are about the use of adaptogens for postpartum, correct?</p><p>When you say you’re seeing different concentrations/recommended doses — are you referring to different sources online? If so, it’s very common to see a variety of dosage suggestions for herbs online. Starting small/slowly for postpartum is always strongly advised. Happy to add to this if I’ve missed something in your question here!</p><p>The primary reason it’s not advised to take them long-term is not that it’s particularly unsafe, more because we don’t want them to become a crutch to achieve balance. Ultimately we adjust other lifestyle factors that may be impending this. However, this is admittedly more difficult in the postpartum period.</p><p>Adaptogens work differently with all people, so first and foremost we’d advise clients to listen to their bodies. People who are more in tune with their needs feel intuitively called to stop when they’ve had enough. Again, admittedly more difficult in the postpartum period! Generally speaking, I suggest 3 months, then taking a break for 2 weeks or so to reassess how their body responds.</p><p>Ultimately though, don’t feel it’s necessary to advise on anything you don’t feel comfortable with! We talk about this more in Business Development. You could partner with an herbalist that specializes in postpartum as well. Hope this helps, and again, happy to elaborate.</p>]]></message>

<message><![CDATA[<p>Hi Carley. <br>Sorry about that. I should have started a new thread! Yes, I am asking specifically for the postpartum period.</p><p>Thank you for taking the time to respond. <br>I had a look at various adaptogens available online to familiarize myself with what the options look like should I ever be asked to recommend one and the recommended doses for each brand of ashwagandha for example varied quite a bit. I guess if I were to recommend one, I would advise the recommended dose on whichever product/brand despite the dose? Or do you have a dose per adaptogen that was covered that you would advise as a starting point?</p><p>I appreciate the additional guidance to start slow, your recommendation for length of time and the suggestion to work with an herbalist. I'll definitely explore this more as I'd like to feel more informed in this area.</p>]]></message>

<message><![CDATA[<p>Hi Emily, I’m glad you asked this question. I should add this list to the curriculum.</p><p>Often times, knowing if the brand is reputable helps. Do the other nutrients they sell come in preferable forms?</p><p>The oils have no off-putting fishy taste or odor (beyond the usual smell/taste associated with fish).</p><p>- Look for one that contains the triglyceride forms, which are more stable, easier for the body to absorb, and have shown greater effectiveness when compared to ethyl ester forms. Ethyl esters are made of one fatty acid attached to one ethanol molecule (not found in nature, created through chemical synthesis). This is not often on the label, but something to look into when researching brands.</p><p>- Sourced from fish low on the food chain to reduce risk of heavy metals, pesticides, PCBs, and other toxins.</p><p>- Sometimes the oils will be tested by a credible third party (such as International Fish Oil Standards/IFOS or ISURA in Canada).</p><p>- Their fish is sustainably sourced with a low environmental impact.</p>]]></message>

<message><![CDATA[<p>I have a random question about umbilical cords. Can high blood sugar cause a large umbilical cord? When my daughter was born 2 years ago, her umbilical cord was rather large and even the nurses had said they had never seen anything like it. The doctor never said anything and I had a very easy and healthy pregnancy(minus some key lime pie when I had sweet cravings). She was born 8lbs 4 oz but i'm wondering if maybe I had high blood sugar and didn't know it and as a result, my daughter had a big umbilical cord.</p>]]></message>

<message><![CDATA[<p>Hi Kara Ann. It can be quite annoying, but it's not known to be harmful in pregnancy, nor is it currently liked to anything specifically. Magnesium is a great suggestion. Epsom salt baths as well. Movement is highly recommended: walking, stretching or yoga. Some women find warm or cold packs to be helpful. And while it's not always immediate, massage can often help as well. I hope she finds some relief!</p>]]></message>

<message><![CDATA[<p>Hi Breanna, great question. I think it would be really helpful asking her what her favorite foods are, and then asking why she likes them (taste, texture, or convenience of preparation). Beginning with what she already likes and is familiar with can be a good starting place. You can work with her to make the foods/meals she's eating more nutrient-dense, rather than suggesting a bunch of new foods/meals. Stress that her prenatal multivitamin is important, she may even benefit from a morning smoothie that she can load up with nutrient-dense add ins. It's hard to say without seeing her food journal, or knowing why she's unmotivated (limited palate, or dislikes food prep), but keeping things simple is probably your best bet. As well... keep checking in to see if your suggestions resonate with her. Give her a few ideas as follow up with "which one of these feels the best for you", and "how can you see yourself incorporating this food?". So she can start thinking about putting your recommendations into action in her daily diet.</p>]]></message>

I have been looking at some of the recommended daily intakes we discuss in the modules for nutrients in pregnancy and I was thinking some of them would require a woman to eat a lot of food to ensure they reach the RDI.  Do you think this is why it is beneficial to supplement and eat food sources to reach the allocated RDI?  Has this been your experience with women who don't want to take a supplement but are trying to reach their RDI with wholefoods?  Calcium was one that I was looking at for example.</p>]]></message>

<message><![CDATA[<p>This could be a sensitive discussion and I love that you'r being mindful about your response. I definitely wouldn't suggest *everyone* opt out of the injection, the mama would definitely have to be very considerate about consume ample dietary sources. Alternatives may want to be considered in the event of: certain maternal medications, an assisted birth (c-section, forceps, manual), or where immediate breastfeeding is not possible. All that said, ultimately a mother gets to make the decision about the choices she makes for her baby. Care providers work for us, they're not our bosses. She could talk to them about why she might want to opt out, what research she's found on the topic, and when she might consider the injection (reasons listed above).</p>]]></message>

<message><![CDATA[<p>Hi, trust me when I say that I'm a firm believer in a whole foods diet and prefer not to supplement (or recommend supplementation) whenever possible. However, like you mentioned, demands are just so high during pregnancy and it's often difficult to meet these needs adequately through food alone. At least for the way most people eat not — even the ones who eat real/whole foods. This is why I do encourage supplementation during pregnancy in combination with real food sources.</p>]]></message>

<message><![CDATA[<p>Carley,<br>Hi! I’m curious about the difference in commercial meat, or even meat that may be local but not labeled organic, grass fed, pasture raised. During these times, my heart goes out to people who may not have access to these quality meats, or even eggs. A lot of stores are low on inventory too. I feel like some of us can afford these things but it’s important to remember not everyone can. Especially knowing what situation families could be in right now during a pandemic. Would we rather see families eat meat, and do the best they can to choose quality than not eat meat altogether because they’ve been told to avoid commercial meat and choose grass fed, pasture raised and organic? I’m wondering how harmful it is. It must still be better than choosing anything processed or packaged for a meal. Obviously there’s more beneficial Omega 3 fats and such in the meat from them feeding on grass, but is a little grain mixed in going to cause harm to the meat? Just adds more marbling, right?</p>]]></message>

<message><![CDATA[<p>Hi Nina, such a great question and really valuable to discuss. In module 2 there is further clarification on what certain labels mean and how to distinguish their quality. Yes, I do believe that we'd rather see families source what they can while doing their best to choose higher quality cuts when available/affordable. This is absolutely better than choosing processed/packaged meal. If opting for commercial varieties, it's actually best to go for leaner cuts. Although I'd love to help people to stop fearing animal fats (which is a deeply ingrained fear), conventionally raised animals are usually subjected to antibiotics, hormones (in the US), and chemical feed additives, which store in the fat more than the flesh. When talking to clients who can't access high-quality meats for any reason, it's best not to scare them with potential risks, but support them in making the 'better' choices. Much like the variety of options available when supplementing.</p>]]></message>

So if labels can tell you antibiotics, hormones, etc were not used but the animal may not be grass fed or fed organic feed, then that’s at least a little better I’d guess. I’m sure there’s more terms in labeling to learn about. Looking forward to that! Thank you Carley!</p>]]></message>

<message><![CDATA[<p>Hello!<br>When it comes to policy against eating and drinking during labor, is this a law? Can a laboring mother demand food and beverage if supported by a nutritionist or doula?</p><p>How do we handle the vaccine topic?

How would you handle a situation like that?</p><p>Lastly, you mentioned that it isn't required to consult with a woman about her birth preferences. How do we go about bringing this topic up without seeming nosy? Do we wait for them to ask us?

<message><![CDATA[<p>Hi Samantha, it's not mandated by law in any country that I'm familiar with. While a nutritionist or doula can help advocate for a mother, this is something that all birthing women have the right to decide upon themselves. Especially as the practice of denying food/drink during labor is outdated, and nourishment is shown to lead to better outcomes for mother &amp; baby.</p><p>As for vaccines, this is one of the topics that I that I've personally chosen to avoid talking about, both publicly (on social media) and professionally (with clients).</p><p>Great that you're thinking about a mindful approach to discussing birth options with clients. In general I've just felt it out with each client to better judge if this was something they'd align with. It will be different for each client! You could simply say "Have you had any support considering your birth preferences? I'd be happy to share more about this if you're interested". That's supportive and not nosey at all. If they want to get into that, it opens the door to that conversation.</p><p>Hope that helps!</p>]]></message>

<message><![CDATA[<p>Hi Carley,</p><p>One more question! According to your teachings, about 15% of babies are known to pass meconium while in utero. When I had my daughter, she had this and I was totally freaked out because yes, I did use castor oil to induce my labor, and the nurse told me that she sees more babies with it than without, and its totally normal. My daughter was fine and they sucked it right out of her lungs, but still. Looking back, what are your thoughts? I can't imagine that is normal...</p>]]></message>

<message><![CDATA[<p>Hi Carley, just after clarification, in the timeline preview under Fish it says that it is common for babies to have a mild reaction to fish, esp. Salmon. If this occurs do we recommend to clients to not reintroduce fish to their baby again (and consult HCP) or follow the sensitivities healing protocol to attempt reintroduction under this? (Sorry if a silly question, just going over and over things to be thorough).</p><p>Thanks!</p>]]></message>

<message><![CDATA[<p>Great question on an interesting topic. In general it seems (with out knowledge at this time) that "meconium alone cannot be relied on as an indication of fetal distress" BUT that fetal distress CAN increase the risk of aspiration. As such, it's recommended to avoid any interventions that are associated with fetal distress: artificial rupture of membranes, induction/augmentation (syn/pitocin ), directed pushing. Ultimately as a prophylactic measure, but definitely if meconium is known to have passed.</p><p>I love this post: <a href="https://midwifethinking.com/2015/01/14/the-curse-of-meconium-stained-liquor/" rel="nofollow noopener" title="https://midwifethinking.com/2015/01/14/the-curse-of-meconium-stained-liquor/">https://midwifethinking.com...</a></p>]]></message>

<message><![CDATA[<p>I saw that recently as well. It's an interesting concept and I think it's headed in the right direction! Were you able to see the nutrient values listed? As she mentions, it certainly won't cover all of your needs, but it could be a good start. It looks beneficial, but we'd just need to see the values to better understand what to added to a supplement protocol to make it more complete.</p>]]></message>

<message><![CDATA[<p>Hi Suzanne, in general I don't recommend liver 'detoxers' during pregnancy. As anything that's detoxed from the body at a higher than normal rate increases the chance that toxins might pass through the placenta. That said, Livaplex doesn't appear to have any strong detox agents, mostly just liver support. However, it does appear to contain animal extracts, including bovine liver, kidney, prostate, and adrenal. Extracts have not been tested in pregnancy, and while they may be ok, I don't feel comfortable recommending them. The 2 that give me the most pause are the adrenal and prostate (as prostate extract isn't something I'd associate with pregnancy wellness).</p>]]></message>

<message><![CDATA[<p>Don't apologize, that's exactly what this board it for and it's a great question. Generally speaking, those with a fish allergy have a low risk of having an allergic reaction from pure fish oil. That is because reaction occur from the protein, and while the oil may contain some protein, it's mostly just fat (oil). So for most baby's it's okay. For a high-risk baby, they may want to offer vegan oil instead. And to note, that just because a baby has been introduced to fish oil without an allergic reaction does not mean that they won't have a reaction to fish once introduced in food form.</p>]]></message>

<message><![CDATA[<p>Hi Again,<br>One of my client's prenatal vitamins doesn't contain Vitamin A. Since there is a lot of caution around vitamin A supplementation, would it be best to recommend food sources of vitamin A for this client. This client also hasn't eaten meat since 2010 and just started eating eating 1-2x per week the month before she got pregnant. Hesitant to recommend vitamin A supplement? Hoping for a bit of help understanding more about vitamin A supplementation?</p>]]></message>

I hear about it a lot, and it definitely seems to get things moving! I think it’s worth considering the risks of that, when baby is breech or not ready to move around just yet. It’s possible you can give a bit more of a nudge than you should before 37/38 weeks. Thoughts?</p>]]></message>

This can increase Braxton Hicks (thought of 'practice contractions') but these or RRL won't initiate labor before the body is prepared.

<message><![CDATA[<p>Yes great question. We really don't want anyone to feel as though they've been making the wrong choice in their pregnancy to date. You can say that her one a day was a wonderful start, but that nutrient needs really increase in the the third trimester, and you have some suggestions about how to help her meet those needs most efficiently. You can highlight the different nutrient forms in your new recommendation and relate them to her specific stage of pregnancy 'now' so that it's about making smart changes going forward - not about condemning what she's done in the past. Hope that helps!</p>]]></message>

<message><![CDATA[<p>Yes food sources are a great recommendation for this client. This will be much easier for her to meet now that she's incorporating animal foods into her diet. Maybe she'd be interested in taking desiccated liver pills? Great idea for someone who doesn't like 'eating' meat, but also an amazing source of food-based vitamin A. Grass-fed is best here. A half dose (as per label recommendation) every couple days (not every day) is sufficient.</p>]]></message>

<message><![CDATA[<p>This is what's known as a proton pump inhibitor (PPI). These work by blocking acid production, so they're not ideal as acid is such an important part of proper digestion. That said, it's understandable if this may be a last resort at times. Ultimately we could hope to support clients in reducing the use of these though. Chris Kresser has several fantastic blogs about PPI use if you're interested in reading more.</p>]]></message>

<message><![CDATA[<p>Hi, these are actually predominately omega 3s rather than omega 6. Interestingly, omega 3 is known as an anti-inflammatory oil, whereas omega 6 is known as an inflammatory oil (especially when processed). So in theory (and in practice for many), fish oils tend to lessen breakouts. That said, everyone reacts differently to foods and it's important to honor that. Jawline breakouts are commonly associated with hormonal imbalance. There are so many things to consider when tackling acne, it's hard to pinpoint. However, general nourishment, whole foods, and proper hydration can go a long way. It would be worth testing how she does with cooked or canned fish vs fish oil as well.</p>]]></message>

For *some* people, too much iodine can worsen hypothyroidism. However, this is more common with high dose (and the OBA recommendation is just the regularly recommended RDA 290 mcg/day).</p><p>You can suggest food sources to ensure this client is meeting the RDA.</p><p>The best practice for supplementation here is to suggest that your client have their iodine levels tested to help determine their needs. Also to confirm with their prescribing practitioner in case supplementation would impact their synthetic thyroid medication.</p><p>Good luck with this volunteer!</p>]]></message>

<message><![CDATA[<p>Hi Samantha, It's great that you recognized this. As stated in module 4 "Most pregnant women only consider their blood sugar levels if they’re<br>diagnosed with gestational diabetes. Yet high maternal blood sugar<br>(hyperglycemia) has been shown to disturb proper fetal development, and<br>lead to higher birth centile. High insulin levels in early pregnancy have also<br>been linked to an increased risk of neural tube defects and increasing the<br>risk of epigenetically predisposing a baby to developing diabetes later in<br>life."</p><p>While we don't want to scare clients with risks, high maternal blood sugar does carry risk for mother and baby. Finding healthy substitutions for sugar will be covered much more thoroughly in Foundational Nutrition. Along with resources to help your clients. For now it would be best to help her as much as you can with the current information you have available to you.</p>]]></message>

<message><![CDATA[<p>Hi Kristen, great to hear that all looks well with baby so far. Generally speaking, MCI is rarely associated with negative outcomes. These mothers will be monitored to ensure they don't develop a velamentous cord insertions, which comes with greater risks, both in pregnancy and during labor/birth. There isn't really any support we can offer these clients, with the exception of supporting their overall diet/nutrition.</p>]]></message>

<message><![CDATA[<p>Hi Sanchita, I do agree that regular baby-safe spoons would be ideal. The num nums are a neat novelty, however, they're more for tasting and less efficient for eating much of terms of quantity. Most babies don't have the dexterity to use spoons when they're younger, but by the time they're ready (often 9+m) I would encourage a transition to regular spoons / finger foods at that point. If baby can lift spoon to mouth, they can also eat finger foods, and the biting/chewing if actually more beneficial for them.</p><p>As for the shied, I don't recommend that shape as it's actually best (and safer) to let baby learn how far they can comfortably put things in their mouth. Spoons may cause gagging, but it's all part of learning. They don't cause significant risk of choking due to the shape. Especially if an adult is with baby while using utensils.</p><p>In terms of material, I really love silicone. I share a few of my favorite products here: <a href="https://www.ohbabynutrition.com/blog/oh-baby-faves-feeding-baby" rel="nofollow noopener" title="https://www.ohbabynutrition.com/blog/oh-baby-faves-feeding-baby">https://www.ohbabynutrition...</a></p>]]></message>

<message><![CDATA[<p>Babies around 6m are only just beginning to exhibit this and may start practicing with toys and such. It will take several months to master this skill and use the pincer grasp with efficiency. While it's often listed as a developmental sign of readiness (and we've listed it as such in this module), the others are much more important to reach. As you said, not all babies display this at 6m, and therefore, not all parents notice their babies using it.</p>]]></message>

<message><![CDATA[<p>Hi Suzanne, so glad you brought this up. Slippery elm bark has a bad reputation in pregnancy for a good reason. Its outer bark has been used in abortions that women attempt on their own. <i>(Graphic warning: By inserting the outer bark through the cervix, the pieces absorb water and expand to dilate the cervix and induce an abortion. This is a very risky method and women have died to infection.)   </i></p><p>So you can see why ‘slippery elm’ has a bad name.  However, while most herbs/plant remedies have not been adequately studied to prove safety, ingesting the *inner bark* (what is found in supplements) ORALLY has not been shown to cause harm, and can help ease things like heartburn/constipation.</p><p>Although, it’s 100% up to the client if they feel comfortable with this or any recommendation we make.</p><p>Hope that helps!</p>]]></message>

<message><![CDATA[<p>Not to worry, this is totally normal and very common. It's more typical to notice with green or orange foods, such as pumpkin. As breast milk contain no fiber, their system is just getting started with the process. It takes time, but you will likely see undigested food in the beginning. And even for longer periods with certain foods (corn, soybeans, chia seeds). This happens in adults too, we just don't get as up close and personal with our stool.</p>]]></message>

<message><![CDATA[<p><i>• Along with some puree on the tray do we encourage placing a bowl and spoon on the baby’s tray from the start?</i><br>A: When baby is just starting solids, it's often difficult to use a bowl/spoon. At this time they usually require an adult to assist with spoon/bowl. Placing puree on the tray is best done before a feed and when (if) changing flavors to help baby get familiar with the taste.</p><p><i>• How long can we store frozen food?</i><br>A: Are you referring to frozen purees? It's best if they are used within 3 months.</p><p><i>• If they are not eating or don’t want more – how do we decide if we should wait a bit and try again or just leave it . what if sometimes they are rejecting not because they are full but because they are distracted or bored</i><br>A: It's hard to provide a standard answer here and this will be different for each situation. It's recommended to remove/reduce all distractions when baby is eating. If they're distracted, the parents can stop the meal and try again later. If they are bored, that's usually a good sign that they are not hungry and do not want more food at that time.</p><p><i>• If the client chooses blw- how do they learn spoon feeding eventually? How do we introduce rice and other foods that are difficult to eat with hands.</i><br>A: Having the manual dexterity to eat with a spoon is a developmental milestone that will be achieved as they mature. A baby who self-feeds (BLW) will have better practice with this manual dexterity than a baby who is spoon-fed.</p><p><i>• For BLW, is it encouraged to put few different foods at a time- the problem I have seen is once a baby likes a certain food then after a point if you put for example tofu carrots and broccoli then they only tend to eat what they like and leave the rest. How can we help with that?</i><br>A: Exposure is key. Babies often require numerous exposure to the certain foods before they accept it. The parent could start the meal with the food they tend to be less fond of. However, we all (humans) have preferred foods. As long as all options are healthy and nutrient-dense, then I support letting baby choose what/how much they consume.</p><p><i>• For sharing meals- do we urge our clients to eat the same food as the baby or is it more about the idea of eating together.</i><br>A: Ideally foods would be the same, primarily for ease. There is no need to prepare 2 separate meals, as long as the foods are baby safe/appropriate. Of course this may not be the case 100% of the time. During these times, sitting together still offers benefits.</p><p><i>• Should we not use the word weaning when working with clients or do we stick to introducing solids.</i><br>A: It depends on where you live and what is customary. In the UK, weaning means to start solids. In North America, it means to discontinue breast milk.</p><p><i>• If they ask what time is best to start with solids- we say in between milk feeds and also I guess morning time to make sure we can assess any reactions?</i><br>A: 1. Whenever the most people from the household are eating together. 2. In between milk feeds, when baby is not too hungry or too full. 3. Not before a nap/bedtime when introducing high-risk allergenic foods.</p><p><i>• Till when do you offer safe baby foods in the sense we cut the foods in stick shape till when?</i><br>A: Each parent will have to gauge their child's own level of comfort and capability. The more teeth they have, the more capable they *may* be. We cannot provide 'an age' as it may not be appropriate for all. I liken it to the same question as "when can you leave your child alone in the bath?" There is no 'one age' that is appropriate for that answer.</p>]]></message>

<message><![CDATA[<p><i>1- do we need to tell our clients to sterilise all feeding equipment?</i><br>In North America, it's only recommended to sterilize until 3m of age. After that it is not considered necessary, but that may differ depending on water quality of where you live.</p><p><i>2- how do you recommend we advise them to cut blueberries. if we just cut it in half it still has a round shape is that okay?</i><br>No round shapes are advised for babies. All round foods should be halved/quartered. As such, blueberries typically aren't an appropriate finger food until baby has use of pincer grasp.</p><p><i>3- in terms of reoffering rejected foods should the client take a few days break or is it ok to keep offering every day</i><br>Everyday is not necessary.</p><p><i>4- what if the baby refuses to sit on the high chair</i><br>In my experience this is much more likely to occur when baby's signs of fullness are not acknowledged, and they are encouraged/pressured to eat more than they are inclined to. In this case, baby can can have negative associations with their high chair.</p><p><i>5- if a baby doesn't want to eat in the high chair and then after a while the client tries again and the baby eats somewhere else like while sitting on the sofa or while playing is that okay or is it promoting a behaviour that they can eat anywhere they want?</i><br>Offering food while baby is playing is not recommended because baby should be focused on eating to be fully in touch with fullness cues. On the floor with a blanket, or on a lap are ok while breaking the negative association with the high chair.</p>]]></message>

<message><![CDATA[<p>hi had two questions:<br>1- I have seen a lot of moms and I did this my self- if a baby is gagging or coughing they tend to give them water to swallow the food- I am guessing this is not advised.<br>2-after a baby turns 1, if a client asks us, there will be times a kid just refuses their food- for example the client made tofu rice for lunch. since the first year It is more about the milk providing nutrition- but post a year focus is on food for nutrition- what should we advise our client to do. do we say they just remove the kid from the situation and try again in a bit  and then if they refuse to just leave it till the next meal? I would think offering the kid something else would not be suggested right? I think the issue parents will feel is that then the kid won't sleep well if they don't eat.</p>]]></message>

<message><![CDATA[<p>Hi Carley, hope you and your family are doing well. I have a question. The current research shows that breastfeeding exclusively for the first six month and then continue with introducing solid food after is good for nutrition, baby’s immunologic protection and baby’s growth development. However, I was wondering if it’s also recommended for bottle-fed babies. Is there anything that we need to consider if baby is bottle fed?</p>]]></message>

<message><![CDATA[<p>1. Correct it's not recommended because if baby is gagging it could indicate that the food they are attempting to swallow is too large and is triggering their gag reflex. Giving water while baby is gagging will 'push' the food down the throat, which could increase risk if chocking. I'd definitely advise against that in favor of allowing baby to resolve it on their own by continuing to gag. It's noisy but it truly is beneficial for them. <br>2. Pickiness with toddlers is such a complex topic and much too broad to attempt to answer properly on this forum. We hope to provide a certification course for toddlers in the future, but this specific course focuses primarily on starting solids.</p>]]></message>

<message><![CDATA[<p>Ah I see, it's that milk/formula needs to remain part of baby's diet to help provide important nutrients that baby wouldn't be able to get from food alone. So milk/formula is needed until at least 1 year, however, food is also needed after 6(ish) months to help meet other nutrient needs that milk/formula alone won't provide.  So in that sense, I suppose for clarity we could say that "breast milk/formula is 'a' primary source, but not the 'only' source of nutrients needed from 6-12m"</p>]]></message>

But if it's soft/appropriate baby-friendly food and baby is actively coughing/gagging, it is best to let them do this and bring the food forward/out on their own. Reaching fingers towards the back of their throat is not advised.</p>]]></message>

<message><![CDATA[<p>1.Would we suggest to moms to buy only organic in the beginning? If so for how long? Also if they cant get organic- I have read of several ways to remove pesticides, I found the veggie wash had too many ingredients but somewhere I read about adding 1 tablespoon of baking soda in a bowl of water and let the fruits and veggies soak for a bit. What would you suggest we tell our clients when they cant get organic?</p><p>2.In some of the weaning books ive read they have different stages of food to offer like stage 1 for first month, then they move on to stage 2 which is once the babies accept stage 1 foods then they can try stage 2. We have a comprehensive- how do we advise clients when they ask us which ones to introduce first and which ones to move on to after. For example, in terms of which veggies and fruits to offer first.</p><p>3.Is there a difference of which foods to introduce first whether BLW or spoon feeding.</p><p>4.When is it okay to introduce fish?</p><p>5.When introducing all foods do we advise them to try the same food for three days to note for any reactions- even if the food is not an allergen food? A lot of weaning books recommend this so for example three days apple puree.</p><p>6.When adding oils do we need to test it first on the babies for few days to check if they are okay with it and can they start from the start or once babies are comfortable with foods. For example, if a mom prepares a pear for the first puree. Should she cook it in oil or wait till after the baby accepts it for three days. Then try it first with oil and then move on to the next?</p><p>7.For herbs and seasonings, can babies be allergic to it?</p><p>8.When can fermented vegetables be introduced?</p><p>9.Do fruits and veggies lose their nutrients when baked or heated?</p><p>10.Is sunflower oil an oil to avoid?</p><p>11.For salt- do we advise to just introduce after a year and then just a little Himalayan salt</p><p>12.Delay full seeds/nuts till all molars are there is what we studied- but that means around 19 months? From what I understand round foods and full forms of seeds and nuts shouldn’t be offered until around 5 years?</p><p>13.For tofu I have read it’s a great source of calcium but in our module we learn to limit it. What is an okay amount for a baby.</p><p>14.Why is it that babies can get rashes from citrus foods</p><p>15.For complimentary beverages- is there certain amount of water they should have in first year</p><p>16.A few people were asking me if they should give oats as first food like oat cereal- I am guessing I should tell them no because it is processed and hard for babies to digest in the beginning and rather focus on fresh foods to start?</p><p>17.For cow’s milk- wanted to clarify we read that pasteurization kills lactase- but does that mean the lactase in the milk- don’t we have lactase in our bodies to help digest the lactose already- do we need to get it from the milk as well?</p><p>18.I was reading about pasteurization and they say that this is very important to make sure that milk is safe to consume that is why they do it. Therefore, what version is a healthy milk for us to have. Pasteurization kills the harmful bacteria.</p><p>19.So for cow’s milk we suggest that it should only be had post 12 months and should be organic, grass fed and do we mention it shouldn’t have a1 casein? Also is it okay if a baby doenst have cow’s milk in their diet? Can we say they just need to make sure to get calcium, protein from other sources?</p><p>20.Regarding formula- a lot of moms if they don’t get enough breast milk or they decide to stop it at 6 months- they then revert to formula- now formula is also made up of cow’s milk so are we saying babies should not have formula either? Also I noticed after 1 year- formula milk has skim milk not full fat- do you know why? Would we also suggest that after a year babies don’t need formula or cow’s milk ? that they can get nutrients from food then?</p><p>21.For butter- we study that is a great source of fat and crucial for babies. In indian households, we use a lot of ghee. My question is what is the difference between the store shelf butters that we get- are those bad as well? Which other sources or brands of butter are good?</p><p>22.Salt do we recommend not including it in diet for the first year and then after that just recommend unrefined salt?</p><p>23.For plant based babies, do we recommend to definitely take an iron supplement or can they get enough from foods. Whats a good brand for iron supplements for them?</p><p>24.For dha , we have a whole list of fish that a baby can consume- is there restrictions as to when to introduce which fish for example, salmon and sardines.</p><p>25.Any specific recommendations when having to cook liver  or any other meat parts for babies?</p><p>26.I was speaking to my husband about DHA and telling him only source of it is marine algae as the rest are hard to absorb and it is essential for brain growth. He then asked me that there are so many millions of indian in india who gew up without marine algae and they are so smart. How is that possible? Wasn’t sure of the answer lol.</p><p>27.How much omega 3 do babies need?</p><p>28.A lot of algae dha supplements have an oil like sunflower oil is that okay?</p><p>29.For plant based babies, how can they get vitamin D from foods</p><p>30.Are we allowed to recommend supplements as a consultant?</p><p>31.What if they ask us for recipes or how to prepare the purees? A lot of books give meal plans and recipes.</p><p>32.For plant based babies- do leafy greens like spinach need to be introduced earlier in terms of iron ? some</p>]]></message>

<message><![CDATA[<p>Hi Meg, thanks for sharing that with me. These are my thoughts...</p><p>1. Ideally we would get to a place where delayed cord clamping at birth is more common place. Doing so (even as much as 3 minutes) allows for 50% more blood volume to transfer from placenta to baby. This results in improved iron status, reduced prevalence of iron deficiency at 4m, and approximately 1 additional month’s worth of iron stores at 6m. With this, we wouldn't have to unnecessarily introduce solids prematurely just to account for iron store lost due to early clamping at birth.</p><p>2. Studies I've referenced show the window of opportunity to be between 6-9 months, and we definitely advise introducing bitter/sour flavors in that period. I've personally not seen research showing benefits of introducing bitter/sour between 4-6m being superior.</p><p>3. Research shows the early introduction (between 4-12m) of allergic foods is beneficial, but specific research to date (that I know of) doesn't show the benefits of starting at 4m vs 6m. However, the benefits of waiting until all developmental signs of readiness are present AND introducing allergenic foods between 6-11m has been proven. I believe they're making a leap that if 6m is good, 4m must be better. But there is room for more research in this area and I'm sure it's something we'll see over the next few years!</p>]]></message>

<message><![CDATA[<p>a lot of books suggest trying the same food for three day then moving on to the next. in our studies , it is suggested we don't need to do that because the first food lists are safe foods. but wouldn't we want to try the same food for two or three days for other reasons like to see if the baby gets constipated, or upset tummy or something else? or to also see if they reject it first day then try two more days to see if they warm up to it?</p>]]></message>

<message><![CDATA[<p>After watching your video about Vitamin D3, I did not know that our skin had cholesterol that transferred sun rays to D3. Pretty amazing! Do you think there is a correlation between people who eat PUFAs and how easily they may burn? From what I have read, eating food with cholesterol is not what raises your cholesterol but does it secrete through our skin and then oxidize?</p><p>Thanks!</p>]]></message>

<message><![CDATA[<p>Ohh such a great question. To be totally honest, it's not something I've looked into or researched at great length. But a quick look has turned up some interesting results in terms of fatty acid intake a how it protects the skin. A few points:</p><p>- "Omega-3 EFAs protect against the damaging effects of sunlight by modulating the UVR-induced inflammatory response in the skin."<br>- "EPA supplementation for three months led to an 8-fold increase in the EPA content of the skin, increased the MED (reduced risk of sunburn)."<br>- "As omega-6 is converted into compounds that participate in inflammatory and immune reactions, their levels in skin can influence the cellular response to ultraviolet radiation"</p><p>I haven't looked into it enough to really weigh in, but it seems as though omega 3 PUFA are protective due to their anti-inflammatory properties. So making a leap, you could postulate that due to the inflamatory nature of omega 6 PUFA, they may increase the risk of skin damage from UV radiation, especially if they are from industrial seed oils that are highly refined and more at risk of being oxidized.</p>]]></message>

<message><![CDATA[<p>Ohhh another good one. First let me say that this is *highly* controversial. Between you and me (and anyone else reading this comment I suppose) I have helped some of my personal friends down this path, while making it very clear that they were 100% responsible for their decision. However, for liability sake, I can't advise a client to do this. And, again—for liability sake, OBA can't advise our students to recommend this to their clients. Raw milk is illegal on Canada (where OBA is based) so I legally can't recommend it's consumption as per my regulations. Aside from that, in order to stand behind the formula recipe with any confidence, I'd have to review and compare the specific nutritional breakdown. I have heard that their liver recipe is too high in vitamin A though, but I have't run the stats.</p>]]></message>

<message><![CDATA[<p>Quick question for calculating total intake of Vitamin A:<br> If a client is consuming both types in their diet ( liver and sweet potatos) and their prenatal contains retinol ( i know not preferred). Do you recommend an additional beta carotene supplement? Or is the goal to meet all 75mg of the beta carotene regardless of the retinol intake? Or do you convert the retinol intake to mcg and add it to the beta carotened trying to reach 75mg?</p>]]></message>

<message><![CDATA[<p>Hi Kristen, <br>I see how providing the RDA for beta carotene might be confusing, but it actually just mater how 'all' sources of vitamin A (beta carotene included) convert to RAE. You want to ensure that your client is consuming at least 770 mcg RAE, and no more than a daily maximum of 3,000 mcg RAE. To help you figure that out from different sources, you'd use these conversions: <br>‣ 1 IU retinol = 0.3 mcg RAE <br>‣ 1 IU supplemental beta-carotene = 0.3 mcg RAE<br>‣ 1 IU dietary beta-carotene = 0.05 mcg RAE</p>]]></message>

<message><![CDATA[<p>This will be unique for each student, dependent on where you live and what type of insurance you secure. Generally speaking it is a good idea though.

<message><![CDATA[<p>Hi Carley!</p><p>Somewhat unrelated to the content in this module, specifically... But I keep coming back to your line about not referencing animal studies "for a variety of reasons", before making an exception for a study on rats and post-reproductive cycle DHA levels. Would you mind sharing a bit more about your views on this?

<message><![CDATA[<p>I know this isn't the most 'measurable' response, but honestly, the mother would likely be able to tell. Does the mastitis feel faint, she may be questioning "is it really mastitis or isn't it?". If she's had it before she'll likely be able to identify it in its earlier stages, and she'll even be able to *know* that it is indeed still the earlier stages. In its early stages it may still feels like a plugged duct. However, if there is moderate-significant pain, if it's quite hot/red, or if she has a fever, then it would be considered too advanced.</p>]]></message>

<message><![CDATA[<p>Great question. The idea that animal studies can be accurately used to predict the same impact on human health has long been a contentious issue. Animal studies can't account for the same gene regulation and expression that exists in humans. A few examples as it relates to pregnancy...</p><p>Acutane (a drug for acne) does not cause birth defects in mice or rats, but it does when used by humans during pregnancy.</p><p>The same is true for thalidomide (known in Australia as Distaval), which was used in the 50s &amp; early 60s to treat morning sickness. It was shown to be safe with animal studies, but tragically went on to cause severe birth defects and death in human babies.</p><p>I can't discredit that animal studies have undoubtedly provided significant medical advances for the human race, but there are also many people that feel animal studies are an ethical concern. All that said, I personally feel that human studies are a more reliable reference to use throughout the OBA curriculum.</p>]]></message>

<message><![CDATA[<p>Hi  Carley, hope you and your family are all well:) I have a question. I know the acidity of citrus fruit may cause a diaper rash and/or a rash around a baby’s mouth. However, I was wondering if it’s the same with tomatoes. Also, are tomatoes considered as allergic food for many babies? My baby Lisa might be allergic/sensitive to tomatoes as she vomited that night when she had a teaspoon of tomato purée for the first time. (Although, I’m not quite sure if it’s caused by tomatoes. She might have been just tired and stressed after her first long train ride to her grandma’s and being surrounded by the unfamiliar environment. )  Look forward to your advice. Thank you!</p>]]></message>

<message><![CDATA[<p>Hi Meg, yes you're right. As tomatoes are quite acidic, they can cause a diaper or mouth rash. While they are not considered a high risk allergen, any food can cause an allergy. It's very hard to tell if this vomiting was an allergic reaction, especially without any other symptoms.</p><p>I hope the visit with grandparents was lovely, despite the long train ride.</p>]]></message>

Do you think this would put too much pressure on them? With everything I have learned so far, our body typically gives us symptoms and signals when we are deficient in a nutrient, however, those same signals could just be part of the postpartum experience. Could blood work possibly prevent postpartum depression and thyroid dysfunction? I was also wondering how you felt about it for using blood work to check levels for breastfeeding purposes?</p>]]></message>

For example, vitamin D levels and thyroid as well (if symptomatic).  There are some home tests that you can recommend as a CNC (covered in Business Development). If getting tested in a clinic, just be mindful of accessibility for mothers, both in terms of cost and time investment.</p>]]></message>

<message><![CDATA[<p>Hi Dany, yes this is called birth spacing. First of all, I have to say that this is *highly* personal. Some women get pregnant relatively quickly after having a baby (whether planned or not) and everyone is well and healthy. There are so many factors to take into consideration.</p><p>That said, most health organizations do have recommend “ideals” for spacing between pregnancies. Some recommend waiting until the first child is at least 18 months before before conceiving again (<a href="https://www.marchofdimes.org/MOD-Birth-Spacing-Factsheet-November-2015.pdf)" rel="nofollow noopener" title="https://www.marchofdimes.org/MOD-Birth-Spacing-Factsheet-November-2015.pdf)">https://www.marchofdimes.or...</a>. Others suggest 24 months (<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6711626/#:~:text=After%20a%20live%20birth%2C%20women,for%20the%20mother%20and%20baby.)" rel="nofollow noopener" title="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6711626/#:~:text=After%20a%20live%20birth%2C%20women,for%20the%20mother%20and%20baby.)">https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.go...</a>. Then there are the more antidotal accounts of people recommending 3 year spacing, such as the well know blogger, Mama Natural (<a href="https://www.mamanatural.com/why-i-waited-3-years-between-pregnancies/)" rel="nofollow noopener" title="https://www.mamanatural.com/why-i-waited-3-years-between-pregnancies/)">https://www.mamanatural.com...</a>.</p><p>Regardless, I’ve personally always felt more inclined to help support families in what they feel is best. For the client you mentioned in particular, this would be ensuring she was well nourished to offset the nutritional tax breastfeeding can place on the body.</p>]]></message>

<message><![CDATA[<p>In this case you would be supporting the body's own collagen production. This requires amino acids (from protein). So when it comes to plant-based diets, it's important to ensure that a variety of plant-based proteins are consumed (to combine all essential amino acids). Collagen production also requires vitamin C and zinc.</p>]]></message>

<message><![CDATA[<p>Hi Carley, I had someone approach me with an interesting question. She told me that she thought it was advised to take a prenatal during her entire childbearing years. I actually remember this being a "fad" when I was in college 10+ years ago, biotin was having a "moment" and everyone was taking prenatals to get luscious skin and nails. I tried to look into this a bit and found some information that supports my gut reaction that a prenatal should not be taken when not pregnant, breastfeeding, trying to conceive, or a few months prior to. The childbearing years, by definition to me, would be the entire time a woman is menstruating. I just thinking of someone who may be using a prenatal with folic acid, I can't imagine that it would be good for the body to have such excess folic acid intake over the long term. I actually read an article that excess folic acid could mask vitamin B12 deficiencies. Wondering if there are other implications and your professional opinion on this! Thank you!</p>]]></message>

<message><![CDATA[<p>Hi Kara Ann, yes this recommendation does seem to come in and out of popularity. This is actually something that will be covered in more detail when we release our fertility course (one day!). But to sum it up, your gut reaction is correct —the prenatal multi is intended for conception, pregnancy, and breastfeeding. Some nutrients (such as many water soluble ones) would just excrete from the body. However, the minerals and some other nutrients are provided in higher amounts that are not only unnecessary (outside of the times listed) but also potentially harmful. That said, if someone was low in iron (for example) the extra could be beneficial. But it's much safer to get tested and supplement accordingly to your unique needs (instead of higher levels across the board).</p>]]></message>

<message><![CDATA[<p>I have a question about the contraceptive effect from breast milk. From my understanding, breast feeding helps prevent a woman from menstruating and this is the body's way of avoiding pregnancy before it has healed. My question is, why do healthcare workers not make more women aware of this? I remember reading mommy posts about how women became pregnant a few months after giving birth but they were told by someone that it was impossible if they were breastfeeding. This is where I get confused. I know that if a breastfeeding mama has not had her period yet, the risk of becoming pregnant is around 2%. This is a silly question, but if that is the case, do breastfeeding women not ovulate until after their first period? Clearly those women were misinformed but this subject fascinates me because growing up, learning about reproduction in school was not very informative.</p><p>Thank you!</p>]]></message>

<message><![CDATA[<p>I am a little confused with the recommendations on shellfish? It states that shellfish are responsible for most seafood related illnesses and can have high amounts of bacteria and viruses but in the general guidelines section it gives shrimp as an example of what pregnant women should consume for a low mercury option. <br>My question is, does the shrimp they are referring to need to be cooked in that case to lower the risk of bacteria and viruses?

So prawns would only be an appropriate low mercury option when it's properly cooked and stored (ie - not left out on the counter before eating, or eaten at a buffet).

<message><![CDATA[<p>Hi Carley,</p><p>Two questions for ya! <br>- First off, when you mention cow's milk as one of the usual suspects when we're dealing with a fussy baby with tummy troubles—does this encompass all dairy products or just milk? Does fermenting the milk affect this or are the proteins in all these products the same?</p><p>- I remember seeing a post on IG last year by a second-time mom who was having issues with pain while breastfeeding. Apparently it was solved with a session of craniosacral therapy  for baby, who wasn't latching properly. I think there was even an explanation of baby being head down for so long in the womb that his jaw wouldn't open properly once he was born (but I'm foggy on the details, tbh!!) I've been kind of fascinated by this since then and was wondering if you've had any experience with this kind of therapy for babies? There is a bit of information online, but not sure what to make of it. I also spoke to one myofascial/craniosacral practitioner but she had never heard of it..</p>]]></message>

<message><![CDATA[<p>Hi Carley and Kristen. Hope it's OK if I ask my question on this thread as it's related. <br>The one brand of grass-fed liver pills I've been able to find that is currently delivering to Germany is this Vital Proteins one <a href="https://www.vitalproteins.com/products/beef-liver-capsules" rel="nofollow noopener" title="https://www.vitalproteins.com/products/beef-liver-capsules">https://www.vitalproteins.c...</a><br>Each dose (4 capsules) contains 3500IU of Vitamin A. They don't use the RAE units on their label and, I wanted to confirm with you how you'd recommend consuming them with a pregnant client. My volunteer client was adamantly against eating liver but slightly more open to capsules, which I assume is common so I'm trying to build up more knowledge on the options available here...<br>Since the UI for pre-formed vitamin A is 10,000IU/day, would it make sense to suggest normal consumption of these capsules? 4 a day, at 3500IU/day even if it's slightly below the RDA? Similarly, would spacing them out to half of that still provide any benefits? I remember you mentioned sprinkling the powder onto food, and I'm curious to know how mindful of quantities we'd have to be here. I know this information is in the nutrient PDF, my apologies if I'm being redundant! But I feel like this is a delicate subject as there is so much information online extolling the risks of liver during pregnancy that I'd want to confront any skepticism with 100% confidence and reassurance.</p>]]></message>

<message><![CDATA[<p>Hey Anja!</p><p>Cow's milk: some babies may be sensitive to all (most) dairy, but milk tends to be more of a predominant concern. Both breast milk and cow's milk contain lactose, but the lactose in cow's milk is more difficult for humans to digest. Dairy products like cheese or butter have much less lactose and more more fat (making them easier to digest). Other products like yogurt or kefir are fermented making them more easily digestible. While lactose is commonly a concern, but as you mentioned, it could also be milk proteins.</p><p>Craniosacral therapy: To be honest I'm not well versed in this therapy, but it was recommended to me for my son after birth. His labour was long (several days) and -same as the mother you came across - he had difficulty latching, particularly on one side. At this point I wasn't into the idea of leaving the house, so we didn't pursue this and the latch issue resolved (maybe could have found someone to come to our house?). However, I have heard (anecdotally) that craniosacral therapy can be wonderful for newborns. I'd certainly say that at the very least it's not likely to do any harm as t's very gentle! ;)</p>]]></message>

<message><![CDATA[<p>Hi Anja, thanks for your patience with my reply. And no problem at all to jump on this thread! No, you're not being redundant and it's great that you're double checking because, as you said, it can be a delicate subject. It can be a little tricky as you have to factor in your client's total vitamin A intake. What does her prenatal provide? Is she eating dietary sources? If her prenatal only provides beta carotene, and she only eats plant-based sources of vitamin A, then that's not something to be concerned with as the body doesn't store excess of either of these sources. So overall, 4 a day, at 3500IU/day is okay and beneficial, so long as she is not going over 10,000IU/day total from all consumed sources of vitamin A.</p>]]></message>

<message><![CDATA[<p>Hey Anja, great question. Basically it comes down to a personal choice for your client. While many mothers do feel they benefit from consuming their placenta, there are others that don't respond as positively. It's a subject that I've steered away from advising on. It's highly controversial and we just don't have the necessary information to provide proper recommendations one way or the other.</p>]]></message>

<message><![CDATA[<p>Hi Carley, One of my client trials, she stopped taking a prenatal and her baby is 6 months old. Do you still recommend a prenatal or can clients stop their prenatal before they stop breastfeeding? Even if she starts to wean and not breastfeed as much should she still take a prenatal or other individual supplements she may need for a specific nutrient need?</p>]]></message>

<message><![CDATA[<p>Hi Suzanne. If a client is willing and able, a prenatal multivitamin is recommended during the entire period of lactation. Breastfeeding should still be the primary focus until baby is at least 12 months, and her baby is only 6 months old. So unless she plans to wean from breastfeeding to formula, a prenatal multivitamin is ideal. As well as any other individual supplements as needed.</p>]]></message>

<message><![CDATA[<p>While going through the food journal of a client do you typically write out the amount of each nutrient per food or just do a general glance to see the main areas they might be missing (ie. liver, fish, eggs, butter, vegetable and fruit variety, seeds). Or is there a certain website/app that breaks down all the micronutrients? I know FoodData Central does each food individually but is there a site/app that you can input all the food and it will graph the micronutrients for you?</p>]]></message>

<message><![CDATA[<p>Hi Kristen, I definitely just look over the food journal and get a sense of what foods they're consuming and what nutrients these foods provide. Then the conversation would go something like "I don't see any fish on your food journal. Is this something  you consume occasionally?" If yes, I'd encourage the client to increase her intake to 3x per week. If that's not realistic for her, I'd encourage supplementation. We cover food journals and how to interpret them much more thoroughly in Foundational Nutrition.</p>]]></message>

<message><![CDATA[<p>Hi Carley,</p><p>Is it possible for a women to only have a thyroid dysfunction while breastfeeding? I have a client that says her TSH levels are fine but with both of her children, she has postpartum depression up until she stopped breastfeeding. I do not want her to feel discouraged by breastfeeding so I recommended supplements and nutrient dense foods to start right away since she is due in two weeks. I also suggested to get a full thyroid panel done 4 weeks postpartum if her supplements are not helping. Is it possible for pregnant women to only have thyroid dysfunctions while breastfeeding or do you think it is a nutrient deficiency?</p><p>Thank you!</p>]]></message>

<message><![CDATA[<p>Hi Samantha,</p><p>It is possible for women to have thyroid dysfunction while breastfeeding, and it may possibly be because breastfeeding is a nutritional strain on the body. Your suggestions sound wonderful. And it's great that you were conscious about not wanting her to feel discouraged by breastfeeding. If her TSH levels were fine, were there other symptoms that lead you to make the link between postpartum depression and thyroid dysfunction? You're correct that a full thyroid panel would be ideal.</p>]]></message>

<message><![CDATA[<p>You're right on point! Extra folate and iron (a least 30 mg/day) are recommended. Advise her to increase her D3/Calcium in the 3rd tri. No need to add additional B12 supplements unless you have reason to believe that her dietary intake may be low (now and before pregnancy). Ensure that she doesn't just double up' on her prenatal multi, as taking double doses of other nutrients is not advised. I'd also ensure that her multi contains at least 2 mg of vitamin B6. She's lucky to have your support.</p>]]></message>

<message><![CDATA[<p>Hi Melissa, I'm assuming that she's not breastfeeding? If so, 6-8 weeks can be common for menstruation to return. As for her 24 day cycle, it may take some time to regulate again. Although, it's worth noting that some women can find that they have shorter cycles after birth. That said, iron is important for this mother!</p>]]></message>

<message><![CDATA[<p>Hi Carley!</p><p>One of my volunteer clients is in Argentina, where food-based supplements are prohibitively expensive—when not altogether impossible to find. I'm from Uruguay (neighboring country) and would like to work with women from the region after becoming a CNC. One of the things I think about a lot is how hard it is to find good supplements in these countries and how sensitive it would be to recommend buying something that costs 10% of someone's monthly pay.</p><p> This is something I've thought about a lot before but now have to address in my trial. Is there a way to approach or think about supplementation in a more inclusive way?</p><p>I know gummies are not considered adequate, and taking any prenatal is probably better than none— but where on the spectrum of desirability do gummies from Garden of Life fall if the alternative is a Bayer multivitamin made with the cheapest forms of nutrients? After searching online for hours yesterday the gummies were some of the only things I could find as an alternative, and I'm wondering how they stack up in cases like these...</p><p>thanks!!</p>]]></message>

<message><![CDATA[<p>Hi Anja, it's wonderful to hear that you're being sensitive to the potential roadblocks of your recommendations. This is actually something that we're addressing in the next update of the curriculum. Are Garden of Life prenatal gummies available to your future clientele at an achievable price. These certainly would be preferable over the Bayer's multivitamin. The GOL doesn't meet the recommended daily dose for several nutrients, but honestly not many brands do, and you often have to fill in the voids. As an example, it's low in in vitamin D, but that's typically inexpensive to purchase as a stand alone vitamin. Of course, taking into consideration how much bare skin sun exposure your clients are getting. That said, generally speaking, we fully support meeting clients where they're at, and always being considerate to make recommendations that suit your unique client.</p>]]></message>

<message><![CDATA[<p>Hi Kristen, I'd be curious to learn why she would prefer to continue taking the brand with folic acid. We never want to try and force a client to "do what we say" but it can be really helpful to know why so we can help guide them to the next best thing to suit their needs.</p><p>As an example: Maybe a doctor recommended the brand she's taking? In this case she could talk to her prescribing doctor to see if they approve the switch.</p><p>Or maybe she doesn't want to waste the bottle she's already purchased. In this case, she may consider alternating between taking the old supplement one day and the new supplement the next until the old bottle is empty - or just taking the new supplement when the old one is empty (keeping in mind that folate is most important in the 1st trimester).</p><p>If she just loves her brand for any reason (preference/price etc) you wouldn't want to suggest supplementing above/beyond the recommended daily dose. However, a focus on folate rich foods is always a good idea. Hope that helps!</p>]]></message>

<message><![CDATA[<p>Hi Mackenna. This is discussed in baby nutrition, but you've inspired me to add it here as well!</p><p>Studies show that consuming the top allergens while pregnant is linked to a reduced risk of her baby developing allergies in the future. That said, she should not consume them if she has a severe allergy. The top 8 are: milk, eggs, fish, crustacean shellfish, tree nuts, peanuts, wheat, and soybeans. If a women doesn't usually consume these foods, but is willing to, she doesn't have to make these foods a regular part of her diet. A few exposures throughout pregnancy should suffice. Of course, not all will be open to this for personal preferences (such as most vegans, for example).</p><p>Just to note, this helps reduce risk for allergies, but not a food sensitivity, which is a sign that the gut needs additional support. And a food intolerance is due to the body not producing a certain enzyme for digestion (lactose intolerance for example). These are further discussed in Baby Nutrition.</p><p>As for how a pregnant mother's tolerance for certain food changes during pregnancy, this can be quite varied. It is very possible for her to consume things that would normally not agree with her. I myself was able to eat dairy much better during pregnancy (and after) than before. However, some women do become sensitive to things they would otherwise be able to consume without concerns.</p>]]></message>

<message><![CDATA[<p>Hi Kristen,</p><p>Carley is traveling this week with her family, so hopefully I can help in the meantime. We don't typically recommend that clients get overly granular in counting macronutrients, as focusing too much on the numbers can take away from their ability to tap into what their body actually needs in that moment (not to mention checking in after eating to see how they're feeling).</p><p>Instead, a focus on selecting carbohydrates from whole food sources &amp; balancing those carbohydrates by consuming them with foods that contain fat and/or protein to mitigate the raise and crash of blood sugar is recommended. (You'll learn more about this in Foundational Nutrition, too.)</p><p>We know that most women—and especially those with blood sugar management or metabolic disorders—are not likely to thrive when consuming the 175-210 grams of carbohydrates frequently recommended during pregnancy and postpartum. (That's usually much too high.) But the number of carbohydrates necessary for each individual will vary greatly.</p><p>Has she been diagnosed with gestational diabetes?</p><p>I'll check in with Carley when she's back next week to see if she has any specific guidance for twin pregnancies.</p>]]></message>

<message><![CDATA[<p>Hi Carley,</p><p>I have concerns when it comes to pregnant women wearing masks. Previous to the mask mandates, the surgeon general, Dr. Fauci, and many others claimed that masks are useless against the virus and only hold a sense of false security. Now we are being told the opposite. There are plenty of studies showing that wearing N95 masks reduce oxygen levels (has detrimental effects on the body), and it is obvious that breathing in CO2 and bacteria from our lungs will only lead to poor health outcomes. There has been one study that claims no health effects were determined by wearing a face mask for one hour (just an hour?) in HEALTHY pregnant women. Considering that the planet was told a few months ago that masks are useless and there is not one peer reviewed study claiming that "cloth or face coverings" help prevent or slow down the spread of any virus, I think the the risk outweighs the benefit. Not to mention OSHA  came out and said that cloth coverings are not PPE. What is your opinion on this matter? If you have time, please watch the Facebook link below. The woman's name is Kristen Meghan. She is a an EHS toxicologist who is certified with OSHA. She explains the dangers of pregnant women wearing masks.</p><p>Thank you</p><p>CDC study</p><p><a href="https://blogs.cdc.gov/niosh-science-blog/2015/06/18/respirators-pregnancy/" rel="nofollow noopener" title="https://blogs.cdc.gov/niosh-science-blog/2015/06/18/respirators-pregnancy/">https://blogs.cdc.gov/niosh...</a></p><p>Kristen Meghan on face masks while pregnant <br><a href="https://www.facebook.com/kristenmeghan/videos/10222605103253019" rel="nofollow noopener" title="https://www.facebook.com/kristenmeghan/videos/10222605103253019">https://www.facebook.com/kr...</a></p>]]></message>

<message><![CDATA[<p>Hi Carley,</p><p>What do you tell a parent whose child still wakes up in the middle of the night past 8 months old? I had this issue and was told that my child was only waking up out of habit and wasn't actually hungry. Do you think this is true or that they are waking up out of hunger? I'm so weary of advice from pediatricians because ours told us to start our child on solids as soon as she could sit up. Thankfully I listened to my instincts and knew that she wasn't ready with just that one sign.</p><p>Thanks!</p>]]></message>

<message><![CDATA[<p>Hello!<br>I had a question regarding my client trial for a 13 month old with a history of eczema. <br>The mother suspects that he has sensitivities to dairy and gluten. He has been given gluten, which resulted in eczema. However, he has never actually been given dairy. Prior to him being 6 months old, his mother had to remove dairy and gluten from her diet as she suspected it was causing his eczema. He does not experience eczema now with both dairy and gluten excluded from his diet. <br>During our consultation, should I recommend she introduce dairy right away and monitor for a reaction? Or do I recommend she follow the healing protocol for a while and then follow the food sensitivities introduction for gluten as well as dairy?<br>Obviously we will be reviewing the healing protocol regardless, as her son has a documented sensitivity to gluten. Just curious as to how you would recommend handling this specific case when it comes to introducing dairy since he’s never had any directly.<br>Thank you!</p>]]></message>

<message><![CDATA[<p>Hi Lauren, in this case (if the mother is open to it) you could suggest that she introduce dairy to monitor for a reaction/eczema. It's recommended to introduce all of the top 8 allergens before 12 months, so it's beneficial to intro dairy to this baby regardless as they haven't had it yet. Suggest that they try a minimum of 3 intros spaced 5 days apart.</p>]]></message>

<message><![CDATA[<p>Hi Samantha, I absolutely understand your concerns. The mask mandates are incredibly controversial and it’s difficult to weigh in—because as you’ve highlighted—we don’t really have all the data necessary to best understand how they help or hinder our health (and the health of the most vulnerable in our community). Ultimately, we would encourage pregnant clients who are concerned about the impact of wearing a mask (and especially those who feel unwell doing so) to discuss the situation with their midwife or OB. I wish I had more to share on this! My heart definitely goes out to those who are required to wear a mask while in labor.</p>]]></message>

<message><![CDATA[<p>Hi... oh I love the sounds of this! If offering breast milk kefir as a first food I would advise starting with very small amounts to start. Kefir has such a diverse range of bacteria (many of which will be new to baby's system) so too much too soon could cause excess bloating, gas, and tummy rumbles. As for kombucha, it usually isn’t my first choice for babies because it can be a little more difficult to get the fermentation time just right.</p><p>From one of my blog posts:<br>"Sugar &amp; Alcohol: Kombucha is made with tea, water, sugar and a "scoby" (symbiotic culture of bacteria and yeast), also known as mother. The bacteria feed off the sugar, facilitating the fermentation process. If not left to ferment long enough, the beverage will have a high sugar content. If fermented too long, the beverage can become alcoholic. All ferment can produce alcohol, but I find that kombucha produces more of it at a quicker rate. Although store bought kombucha is regulated and should only contain negligible amounts of alcohol, the sugar content would likely be higher and many store bought and restaurant bought kombucha has sugar added to the finished product."</p><p>That said, if you're a confident brewer it could be an okay choice with an herbal tea!</p>]]></message>

<message><![CDATA[<p>That makes sense, thank you! According to the health intake form, the mother hasn’t introduced eggs, fish, or soy either due to eczema concerns based on her son’s reaction to dairy &amp; gluten. So should I advise her to basically follow the allergen introduction plan for the four remaining allergens while following the healing protocol, and then once she has introduced everything then she can try introducing gluten again?</p>]]></message>

This makes it less allergenic and okay to introduce earlier (even many lactose intolerant people can tolerate butter).

<message><![CDATA[<p>Generally speaking, a baby would need to drink about 4 X 250 mL (8 fl oz) bottles of most commercial formula per day to get the recommended 400 IU of vitamin D. Without knowing more, I'd say supplementing would still be best for this baby. They could try supplementing with 300 IU/day, but most drops come in 400 IU (which would still be okay). Some things to consider, how likely is this mother's breast milk to contain sufficient vitamin D? Does she supplement herself? Does she get bare skin sun exposure? Is the baby ingesting vitamin D rich foods on a regular basis?</p>]]></message>

<message><![CDATA[<p>Hi Carley!</p><p>Would you consider cradle cap an allergy reaction? Pediatricians can't give me a straight answer and I've heard some of them recommend Selsun Blue and other medicated shampoos which I know cannot be good! I know a number of toddlers, including my child, that still suffer from it. At first I thought it was from having to formula feed her so I tried healing her gut naturally through supplementing with probiotics, kefir, plain yogurt, etc. My sister in law breastfed her daughter up until 2 and she has it so maybe it isn't gut related? She has even tried putting breastmilk on it and that didn't work. My friend's child is 3 and still has it and it was her doctor who recommended medicated dandruff shampoo which clearly made things worse. Do you know what causes cradle cap? Could it possibly be a food allergy reaction?</p><p>Thanks!</p>]]></message>

<message><![CDATA[<p>Hi Meg, nutritional needs during breastfeeding is a huge and unfortunately too hard to properly advise upon on this discussion board. Are you enrolled in the Postpartum course? But when it comes to excess weight loss, you'll want to ensure you're consuming nutrient and calorie dense foods. These include things such as nuts and nut butters, whole fat organic dairy (if you tolerate it), and coconut products like coconut oil. Try to see that healthy fats are a staple in you meal and snacks, especially combined with starchy carbs - like yams, squash, and pseudo grains. Don't go too long without eating (hard for a busy mother on the go). Dried fruit is also calorie dense and can be great when paired with a blood sugar stabilizing fat like nut butter.</p>]]></message>

<message><![CDATA[<p>While it’s possible to be allergic to one type of bird egg but not others, it's more common that someone will be allergic to eggs from all birds (quail, turkey, duck, goose, etc.). This often occurs because of the similarity in the protein structures among these various bird eggs (known as cross-reactivity). You've inspired me to add this to the curriculum!</p>]]></message>

<message><![CDATA[<p>Hey! I had an inquiry re woman with really low iron - has to have an iron infusion but the doctors have said her absorption is fine, no coeliacs etc, no anaemia, shes pretty healthy, eats red meat etc, period isn't too heavy either.  I was going to suggest she try supplementing with liver, she also has really low vitamin d so I thought cod liver oil would be great for her.  Would you suggest she can take those two in conjunction with each other when they are both high in vitamin A?  Or would she be better to have the liver for the iron and get the vitamin D as a singular supplement? Shes not pregnant atm either.  More just working on her health atm.</p>]]></message>

<message><![CDATA[<p>Hi Samantha, ohhh I have SO much to share about fertility but unfortunately it's much too much to wrap up in this discussion board. I'm not sure if you've heard but we do have a fertility course in the works. I can't speak to a release date yet - but it is in the works. To answer the best I can, yes magnesium is an important part of fertility. It *may* be part of the missing link for some, but there are so many factors to consider when it comes to supporting fertility and uterine receptivity.</p>]]></message>

<message><![CDATA[<p>Hi Alyce, I'm assuming they have her on a doctor prescribed iron? As you know, prescribing physicians are able to get iron supplements in doses that are well above &amp; beyond an over the counter. I'm not sure what the max is where you are, but where I am 35mg is the highest OTC dose. While the iron is in a poorer quality, it's often necessary (she may need digestive/constipation support). All that to say, is that if she's that low in iron a prescribed supplement is likely needed. While liver may help, it'll be secondary. But to get to your question, generally speaking it's best to do liver one day and CLO the next (alternate). If she's low in vitamin D as well, you can advise she take a straight vitamin D on the days she's taking the liver. That type of alternating protocol may prove difficult for some clients to manage, so you'd have to decide if it would be an appropriate reco for this woman.</p>]]></message>

<message><![CDATA[<p>It wasn't completely obvious, but from what I can tell it looks like Spatone provides 5 mg of ferrous sulfate. How many packets is she taking daily? Even if she's taking a couple per day, this doesn't seem anywhere near what she needs to replete such low stores!! I'm not sure who her prescribing doctor is, but I'd HIGHLY encourage her to consider alternate supplementation!</p>]]></message>

<message><![CDATA[<p>Yes absolutely! It's really important to decide what you feel called to support with. I'm very invested in birth trauma and do as much as I can to help mothers prevent it through support in finding an aligned provider, knowing their options, and instructing on how to either get an advocate or self-advocate. But I personally feel less equipped to support instances of birth trauma after they happen. Reason being is that I can tend to get very emotional myself when it comes to learning about birth trauma, which isn't as supportive for the mothers who need this support. As such, I know that someone else who is more specialized and confident in this area is the best referral for my clients. As they would be a better support system for them. If you feel called, I encourage you to learn more in this area. If you don't, I encourage you to find someone you trust to use as a referral.</p>]]></message>

There nothing to say you can't add liver, but I think the most nutrient-dense method would be too make the broth and add cooked liver to it when eating. The only thing that gives me pause is that I haven't really heard of anyone adding it before. Must be a reason.

<message><![CDATA[<p>Hi Alissa, it wouldn't be as mush reversing, but more of their body not 'turning it on'. With epigenetic, we understand that gene regulation can be influenced by our diet and lifestyle inputs. So even if the baby has the gene, it may not impact their life as much. That said, I do really believe that most everyone would benefit from the same recommendations that are given to those who have a MTHFR gene mutation, whether they have it or not. Avoiding folate supplements and folate-enriched foods is worthwhile for everyone in my opinion.</p>]]></message>

<message><![CDATA[<p>Hi, If a strictly plant-based mother consumes B12 supplements herself, then her breast milk will contain sufficient B12 for her baby. Formula will also meet the needs for B12. After weaning, then supplementation will be required for babies/toddlers. From 1–3 year the RDA is 0.9 mcg. Of course, if parents are choosing to raise a plant-based baby, there are several other nutrients to be considerate of, such as choline, iron, vitamin D3, and DHA.</p>]]></message>

<message><![CDATA[<p>Hi Carley,</p><p>For future clients who ask us about the use of probiotics with antibiotics, do you have a recommendation for CFU's per age?

<message><![CDATA[<p>With adults, we generally recommend 30 billion CFU for daily and up to 80 (sometimes 100) for post ABX. So for babies, it's generally about 5 billion CFU, and post ABX this could go up to around 15, however it's recommended to start slowly, as increasing too much too soon could cause bloating and gas.</p>]]></message>

<message><![CDATA[<p>I have a client recently diagnosed with gestational diabetes. She was recommended today by her chiropractor to add chromium to her supplements. Chiro was unsure of dosage.

<message><![CDATA[<p>Hi Victoria, This trace mineral is thought to play a role in glucose homeostasis as a cofactor for insulin. Studies I've referenced show that serum chromium levels do not vary between pregnant women with and without GD. So supplementation likely isn't covering a deficiency. But other studies do show promising results when supplementing in doses above the RDA.</p><p>Some prenatal multis include chromium, but not all as it's commonly found in many foods, such as cheese, meats, fish, fruits, vegetables, and whole grains. You're correct that 30mcg is the RDA during pregnancy, but that's the daily requirement through both food and supplementation. That said, most supplements contain 200-500mcg, and some professionals recommend up to 1000mcg/day.</p>]]></message>

<message><![CDATA[<p>Hi Emily, we're actually adding a lesson in the curriculum about this. My heart goes out to women with this condition. The condition is physiological, and not psychological. And it can happen with one baby, but not others from the same mother. There are a few recommendations that I have...</p><p>- Even though it's not depression, some of the same feelings can occur, such as a disinterest in food/eating. This is strongest during and after the D-MER feelings occur. As such, encourage your client to nourish herself as mindfully as possible between feedings. It's also best *not* to eat while baby is crying, as spontaneous letdown may occur (increasing D-MER).</p><p>- Studies have shown that caffeine and stress lower dopamine, therefore, increasing D-MER intensity. Whereas, dark chocolate (!) can increase dopamine and lower the intensity of D-MER. Sucking on a small piece at the beginning of a feed may help, however, this may turn into a full bar every day pretty quickly ;) Maybe best reserved for when she's feeding in public or other situations where D-MER symptoms are especially unpleasant.</p><p>- If she's interested in learning more, this book is supposed to be quite good (I haven't reviewed it yet) <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Before-Letdown-Dysphoric-Ejection-Breastfeeding/dp/1973480999" rel="nofollow noopener" title="https://www.amazon.com/Before-Letdown-Dysphoric-Ejection-Breastfeeding/dp/1973480999">https://www.amazon.com/Befo...</a></p>]]></message>

<message><![CDATA[<p>Hi Eve, yes you're right. As with the other supplement recommendations we make, it comes down to  absorption and in this case, the most natural — as you stated. Other calcium supplements contain higher does, but it's debated on whether this calcium actually "makes it where it's supposed to go" after consuming. Ensuring they're taking adequate vitamin D and K2 will help with this if she decides to continue taking her current brand.</p>]]></message>

<message><![CDATA[<p>Great question, organic is a much better option and grass-fed dairy is ideal. Not everyone reacts to dairy, but it is one of the most common allergenic foods. It's also responsible for many food sensitivities. It's just helpful to be mindful of and know the signs of a possible reaction to dairy to help support clients. We'll get more into food quality (and labels) in module 2. And there's heaps more about allergies/food sensitivities in the baby nutrition course.</p>]]></message>

<message><![CDATA[<p>Hi Carley! <br>I have a question about the case study, specifically questions 1 and 4. Since you're asking to identify 3 categories that the client may want to be <b>considerate</b> about, but then we should also provide healthy and nutritious substitutes, I was wondering if it means we're exclusively supposed to pick these foods from the "foods to consider" categories, or that we can also use the foods "to find healthy replacements for"? Sorry in advance if the answer is obvious and I missed it - maybe it's a language thing since English is not my mother tongue, or maybe it's just me being exhausted because my daughter is teething... ;) Anyway! I just wanted to make sure I won't pick the "wrong" foods. Thank you in advance for your reply!</p>]]></message>

<message><![CDATA[<p>Hi Carley,</p><p>Does eczema have to be red? Can a child have scaly patches of skin without the red factor or would that be something completely different? I had to formula feed my daughter and I noticed that around 8 months my daughter had two rough scaly patches on her back and then bumps on her chest. Neither were red but I knew that it was caused from most likely damage due to the formula. I gave her probiotics and they disappeared within a month and have now come back due to antibiotics. She drinks milk kefir everyday but I started extra probiotics for a little extra kick in hopes it will clear up faster.</p><p>Thanks!</p>]]></message>

<message><![CDATA[<p>Great questions. We've added some info on blood work in the 'Recommended Reading, Research &amp; Resources' of module 2 in Foundational Nutrition. There are also some recommended affiliates companies for various blood tests in Business Development. You can suggest that your client get blood work from the primary care provider, or recommend some home testing kits. You can review any previous blood work they've had done, if they're comfortable with sharing. A great way to pose this questions is "Are you familiar with the results of any blood work you've had during this pregnancy? I'd be happy to look over these with you if you're comfortable sharing."</p>]]></message>

<message><![CDATA[<p>I know they're popular in the wellness world, but in my opinion, I'd think of IVs as more of a last resort. Maybe the hydration IV for a mother with hyperemesis gravidarum. That said, it wasn't entirely clear what was in them and I want to check that first. As for the other IVs on offer, B12 might be best for a vegan who is low and needs to increase their levels asap. I'd definitely want to know the nutrient form first, for example - is it cyanocobalamin or methylated? Is the vitamin C ascorbic acid? (However, I'd  strongly advise against the vitamin C during pregnancy.) Are there any additives or 'other' nutrients?</p><p>The rapid hydration packets could be useful after a big workout/big sweat, when recovering from the stomach flu, or during labor. I don't see them being that necessary otherwise.</p>]]></message>

<message><![CDATA[<p>Hi Carley &amp; Samantha,</p><p>Jumping on this thread as well, as I've been wondering about a friend's little girl, who was in hospital on antibiotics for the first 3 weeks of her life (mom got listeriosis, emergency c-section, baby miraculously made it albeit with a few hurdles to overcome). <br>She's now a rambunctious toddler but has had dry scaly patches like this on her arms and torso since she was a baby. Like eczema but no redness, and mom thinks they started when solids were introduced and never went away. I suggested the possibility of it being linked to the intensive antibiotics course, and we discussed potentially eliminating allergens to test reaction, but I was also wondering if you'd had any experience with different kinds of skin reactions or what your take could be on it?</p><p>Thanks!</p>]]></message>

<message><![CDATA[<p>Hey Anja,</p><p>It sounds exactly what my daughter has. When my daughter initially had those dry spots, the only thing I could think of was it being caused by the formula. Even though we were using top of the line formula, it's still not breastmilk. When my daughter was about a year and a half I noticed more dry patches and bumps on her chest and stomach but nowhere else. I began giving her grass-fed kefir everyday. After about a month, they completely disappeared up until a few weeks ago when she had to take amoxicillin for an ear infection. The dry patches did not come back but the odd bumps on her chest and stomach did. I have given her kefir every morning since then and after her antibiotics, I began giving her an extra dose of probiotics to help speed up the healing process. The bumps are almost gone which is why I think for my daughter that it is just a reaction from a damaged gut. Is your daughter currently on probiotics or does she eat plenty of probiotic rich food?</p>]]></message>

<message><![CDATA[<p>I also wanted to ask about your opinion on birth control? I feel as if as a nutrition consultant, the subject will come up. Are you an advocate for it, what are your recommendations, and do you support calendar tracking? How do you support a client that wants to stay off of birth control but is worried about getting pregnant? I track my period via an app and it has never failed, however, every woman is different.</p>]]></message>

<message><![CDATA[<p>Thanks for sharing, Anja. How terrifying it must have been for that mother. So glad to hear she's now a rambunctious toddler.  As I mentioned, it can be very difficult to determine the cause of rashes (especially without a visual), but the influences you mentioned may be a contributing factor. Of course we'd want to rule out external factors (laundry detergent, etc.) but I'm sure this family has ruled that out by now.</p>]]></message>

<message><![CDATA[<p>Great questions with a long winded answer. I'm actually working on fertility certification course! There will be an entire module dedicated to birth control. I'll cover the pros and cons of allll methods. But as for my personal preferences, I'm a HUGE advocate for FAM (fertility awareness method). It's incredible for both avoiding and achieving pregnancy. To get personal, I've been in 2 ten year relationships using FAM exclusively. I never had any unplanned pregnancies and then when I did decide to try, I become pregnant on the first try (cycle) with each of my children.

If asked, I've just said "I don't feel that I have enough evidence-based information to properly advise". However, I've also seen some concerning reports <a href="https://www.mother.ly/news/is-cbd-safe-for-pregnancy-breastfeeding" rel="nofollow noopener" title="https://www.mother.ly/news/is-cbd-safe-for-pregnancy-breastfeeding">https://www.mother.ly/news/...</a>.

<message><![CDATA[<p>I tend to find that powder is the best option. It can easily be dusted on a nipple. added to bottles, or given off a clean finger tip. Gummy can definitely jeopardize the quality (as gelatin has to be heat to 'gel') and liquid often requires additives or preservatives to avoid spoilage. But a quality liquid would be the next best choice.</p>]]></message>

<message><![CDATA[<p>As much as I *love* the thought of you proving labor support, it's not something we evaluate during client trials. Due to this, the submission instructions don't include questions to properly align with labor support. Instead we request that your 'pregnancy conditions' volunteer has 2 conditions from module 3 (that have accompanying protocols). Maybe you could review the conditions from the curriculum with her to see if there's something else she might like support with?</p>]]></message>

<message><![CDATA[<p>Hi Lauren, thanks for your patience with my reply. Yes you can use your doc creator of choice (google doc, pages, word, etc) and then add your photos and write your descriptions underneath (all in one PDF). If the file ends up being too large, you can adjust the PDF size. If you can't figure out how to do it on your own, there are several websites that offer file resizing for free! Hope that works out for you :)</p>]]></message>

<message><![CDATA[<p>Hi Carley, <br>I've just received my client trial general health intake form and food diary. My client has noted 'potential overactive adrenals and unbalanced hormones' as a health concern. Obviously this is not within my scope of practice but would you suggest I do some research into this and look at how nutrition may affect this? As the client has used the term 'potential' do I just wait until the consultation to understand where these concerns have come from but also do some research prior to the consultation? Sorry if what to do about a clients health concerns were specified elsewhere.</p>]]></message>

<message><![CDATA[<p>Hi Carley,</p><p>Do you think that vaccine ingredients may also be the cause for increased allergies? I went onto the CDC's website and casein, lactose, dried lactose, bovine serum albumin, bovine calf serum, ovalbumin (main protein found in egg whites), egg protein, and castor oil (may be cross contaminated with peanut oil or mixed with). It makes me wonder, especially because vaccines are delivered into the muscle and straight into the blood stream. The vaccines also contain many types of antibiotics which we know has a massive impact on the microbiome which could also lead to allergies, sensitivities, and eczema. Have you ever come across a child who isn't vaccinated but still has severe allergies?</p>]]></message>

<message><![CDATA[<p>Also, there are many preservatives that release or trigger histamines such as yeast, MSG, formaldehyde or formalin, aluminum, etc. What if these histamines are interacting with the animal proteins in the bloodstream? It may not trigger a reaction initially but what if it's teaching the body to create an excess amount of histamine when it comes into contact with one of those proteins? Obviously there are some children who don't have food allergies or sensitivities but that is when genetics comes into play. If family members have allergies, then the child will most likely also see an allergy due to genetic predisposition? It's interesting to think about considering that allergies/sensitivities can be caused by the introduction of a certain protein too early. It's interesting that they choose two of the most nutrient dense foods to be manufactured with vaccines; dairy and eggs.</p>]]></message>

<message><![CDATA[<p>Hi Leila, such a great question and I'm so glad you asked. It's great that you're being proactive in trying to support this volunteer. Adrenals and hormones are absolutely concerns commonly experienced in pregnancy and postpartum, and they will be discussed further in those courses. For now, we highly advise you to simply say that you aren't trained in these areas as of yet, as you are still early in your studies. If your volunteer has expressed an interest in seeking guidance with these, the best bet would be to refer them to another practitioner who specializes in these areas. Much better then attempting to piecemeal it with advice from the internet.</p>]]></message>

<message><![CDATA[<p>Hi Corina, thanks for checking in with this question. We do discuss diabetes (gestational in Pregnancy) and thyroid conditions (in Postpartum). However, in Foundational we don't expect you to—and don't advise you to—support your volunteer with any preexisting conditions. Please just list them in your intro about this client, and advise your client to review your recommendations with the practitioner they receive ongoing support from for these conditions.  As an example, if you advise a reduction in sugar intake, they may need to adjust their insulin injections. I'm actually have a video clip on this you can check out... <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1MHbdWlD7cgt_AJB2m77GAnfUbcC6M3az/view?usp=sharing" rel="nofollow noopener" title="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1MHbdWlD7cgt_AJB2m77GAnfUbcC6M3az/view?usp=sharing">https://drive.google.com/fi...</a></p>]]></message>

I read the Popular Dietary Preferences document, but in this case the client is not pregnant, so I'm not sure what to do since you specify it's not recommended for pregnant and breastfeeding women, but nothing is said about non pregnant women. What should I recommend? Let's say her skipping breakfast is a deliberate choice, or maybe a habit she's OK with (and not just because she's in a hurry in the morning) - should I still suggest she eats breakfast?

This topic is discussed more throughout the core courses – but now that Foundational Nutrition is first, it would be helpful to talk about up front as well. It's a lot to sum up on the discussion board, so I'll create more info with supporting studies for the curriculum. Give me a few days and I'll ping you here when it's ready for review :)</p>]]></message>

<message><![CDATA[<p>Hi Paola, in these cases I would ask intentional questions to try and gain a better understanding of what this client's health goals are.</p><p>If skipping breakfast was deliberate, what does she hope this will achieve? Is it really making her feel good? Is she tuning into her hunger cues, or ignoring them? Is it increasing her cravings throughout the day? Causing unbalanced blood sugar?</p><p>If it's a time issue, you can help advise her on some ways to create a time-effective breakfast. Dinner leftovers, hard boiled eggs, yogurt (if it agrees with her). And help to explain the benefits so she knows *why* making this time can be a benefit. Maybe more steady energy, less cravings.</p><p>We don't get too deep into this for "general health" as your certification is centered around supporting pregnancy and postpartum. But for Foundational Nutrition, we just want to see that you're asking mindful questions in an effort to support the client with the knowledge you currently have.</p>]]></message>

<message><![CDATA[<p>Hello!<br>Just to be sure, coffee cravings/reliance is a sign of blood sugar imbalance, but it's not likely the cause of blood sugar imbalances, correct?</p><p>For example, if Ella is having symptoms of blood sugar crashes, coffee would not be causing them, and we shouldn't recommend as consultants to reduce coffee intake?</p><p>Does adrenaline and cortisol from drinking a lot of coffee not also affect blood sugar levels?</p><p>Thank you!</p>]]></message>

<message><![CDATA[<p>Although high amounts of caffeine can raise stress hormones, which may reduce insulin sensitivity —  usually it doesn't impact blood sugar too terribly much for healthy adults. Typically, heavy reliance on coffee is the symptom of imbalance, rather than the sole cause. But, it can exacerbate symptoms.</p>]]></message>

<message><![CDATA[<p>1. Pasture-raised = roam freely in their natural environment, consume natural diet of grass/insects. Free-range = allowed access outside for part of the day. The different egg label categories are listed in module 2 &gt; Food Quality.</p><p>2. Unlike store bought broth or stock, which is cooked for only 45 minutes to 4 hours, bone broth is simmered for a substantially longer time, to extract more nutrients. As an example, bone broth can be a great source of collagen — whereas stock is not. There will be more about bone broth throughout the core courses.</p>]]></message>

<message><![CDATA[<p>Hi! There are some suggestions in this module listed as "Substitutions for Allergenic Foods". (If choosing a nut milk - homemade is preferable due to the additives in store bought.) In my opinion, there doesn't *need* to be a sub for little ones. Babies definitely shouldn't be 'filling up' up milk or a milk alternative. But the alts listed could work for making smoothies and things like that. There are no milk alternatives that are nutritionally comparable, so it would just be a matter of taste preference.</p>]]></message>

<message><![CDATA[<p>Hi Carley,</p><p>Perhaps obvious but something I want to make sure of... when we say that premature introduction of solids could be detrimental to a baby's health—does this include the potential to CREATE allergies by giving babies food before their intestinal walls are properly "sealed"? As in, when their gut is still "open"? I assume most of the time allergies would depend on genetic predisposition or environment, but is there also a risk that we might be creating them through failure to wait for developmental readiness for food?</p><p>thanks:)</p>]]></message>

<message><![CDATA[<p>Hi Carley,<br>I have another question about my client trial and I'm curious to know what you think. <br>I was reading my client's health intake form, and I'm having a hard time deciding if she is the most appropriate person for this exercice. For the question "Is there anything you would like to change about your diet?", she answered "Not that I can think of, but I am open to change if it can bring some improvement", and then for the last two questions ("Is there anything else to share about your health status? (Please be as thorough as possible)" and "Are there any specific questions or concerns you would like addressed?)" she just answered "No". So it got me thinking... I'm not sure it's the best person for my first experience, since it's a bit like going to a therapist and telling them there's no need for you to be there - don't know if it makes sense? ;-) I'm asking because I have another friend who told me she'd be interested, so I'm not sure if I'm creating potential problems out of nothing, or if you think it's best to change. Ugh. Anyway, thank you in advance for your insight! :)</p>]]></message>

<message><![CDATA[<p>I've definitely had my far share of those clients as well. Although, sometimes a client isn't very forthcoming on their health intake, but they really open up during the consult. This experience is really about finding ways to support your volunteer in making their diet more nutrient dense. After looking over their food journal, do you see some ways you can support in that way? If not, maybe someone else may be better suited for your first consult. Ultimately it's up to you!</p>]]></message>

Again, unfortunately it's really not possible to share just a few tips as infertility is so complex and any recommendations would be deeply unique. If you're suspecting nutrient deficiency, she could work with a local practitioner to test for deficiencies and hormones levels. Could be a start. Sorry, I wish I had an easy answer for you! ♥️</p>]]></message>

<message><![CDATA[<p>Hmm, can't really think of any off the top of my head (long week - haha). But it's just a matter of preserving shape and texture. So with the example of mushrooms and raspberries, they won't last as long if pre-soaked days before consuming.</p><p>As for produce cleaning products, I haven't seen any studies for proper comparison. So hard to say how they measure up against the others methods listed in the curriculum. But they seem great in theory! If you *really* wanted to get nit picky you could look into if their citric acid was naturally or artificially derived, or if it was derived from GMO sources.

<message><![CDATA[<p>Hi!</p><p>I put the call out on my IG for a volunteer client w/ eczema and got my first two requests pretty much at the same time.</p><p>One case is of a baby who's had eczema (diagnosed by her pediatrician) since she was 2 weeks old and recently had a notable allergic reaction to eggplant (face and neck got red/swelled). The other one is a 7 month old who's gotten occasional flare-ups, from what mom told me, most likely related to the few times she's been given gluten.</p><p>I have agreed to take on case #2 as my volunteer client but would love to refer #1 to someone if that's possible? I feel like they could benefit from the help of a more qualified professional right now. Would you have someone to recommend them to? They are in the NY area, though I assume everything is remote these days.</p><p>Apologies if this is not an appropriate question for this particular discussion board!</p><p>Thank you :)<br>Anja</p>]]></message>

<message><![CDATA[<p>Hey Kayla, so glad you brought this up. I love these conversations!</p><p>Okay, quite a few things to consider here….</p><p>1. As nutrition consultants, we aren’t able to recommend a dose ‘above and beyond’ the Tolerable Upper Intake Level, which happens to be 4,000 IU for vitamin D3. Still always shaking my head that the RDA is 600 IU and does NOT increase during pregnancy or lactation (insert eye roll emoji).</p><p>2. For the most part, the recommended daily doses in the curriculum are set to maintain adequate stores, not replete deficiencies. Norther climates may absolutely require higher doses, but in my experience that’s often because these people become deficient and require the high doses to replete deficiencies. If someone supplemented with 4,000 IU every day, all year long, it’s possible that may be sufficient. But of course, blood work would best help determine that.</p><p>3. Most importantly in this case (and any case like this), if someone is working with a practitioner that has your client on a megadose, it’s always recommended that they ask this prescribing practitioner about best next steps. As you’re not as familiar with their health history, autoimmune conditions, and blood work. Have you followed up with this practitioner to see if this is still their recommended course of action?</p><p>1. That said... I’m almost always a fan of taking smaller doses more regularly. So 7,000 IU 7x/week is 49,000 IU, which to me seems more preferable than 50,000 IU 1/week. But again, they likely had a reason why it was recommended for you.</p>]]></message>

<message><![CDATA[<p>Thank you so much for this thorough reply! Totally makes sense - I know even my naturopath raised eyebrows at the high dose she had me on, and she is known for being a little controversial (which is actually why I love her - as she is so well researched on current studies vs. typical general guidelines set in the 50's - however, which is also why she got fed up being fought all the time here in Manitoba, and has moved to California and closed her Canadian practice just two months ago! So, I'm back to square one with finding a new endocrinologist to watch the remainder of my pregnancy and postpartum thyroid wise!</p><p>Anyways... thank you, and noted re: the Tolerable Upper Limit and consultation, as well as replenishing vs. maintaining. I did just order a Thorne Vitamin D with K2, as I realized my prenatal does not contain K2, only K1, and I'm in the third trimester now! So, I will opt for that route of 6,000 - 7,000 IU 7x/week vs. 50,000 IU 1/week.</p><p>Appreciate you!!!!</p>]]></message>

<message><![CDATA[<p>Hi Carly,<br>I notice that we don't have a section on weight-gain in pregnancy (unless it's in the gestational diabetes section?) Is weight-gain an area that you discuss with clients? I feel comfortable discussing this, but always refer clients to their healthcare provider for charting, as I feel it's out of my realm as a holistic nutritionist to do so. I just wanted to clarify if weight-gain is within our role, and how much detail you go into with clients.</p><p>One other question that I have is about twin/multiple pregnancy and nutrient demands. Do you have any information pertaining to the differences when compared to a singleton pregnancy?</p><p>Thank you :)</p>]]></message>

<message><![CDATA[<p>Yup, all of the recommendations for GD are applicable and appropriate for a client who has concerns with weight gain. Generally speaking I find most charts (infant and maternal weight gain) highly ineffective and often cause more harm than good. I feel that when we consult a client on a nutrient dense diet and how to make healthy substitutions, there often isn't a need to address weight directly. If a client brings it up, I ask if it's their concern or their health providers concern. Then I'll provide recommendations if it's something they want guidance on. But it's not my philosophy to bring up weight loss with prenatal or postpartum clients unprompted. I tend to lean much more towards supporting them in making healthy choices and body positivity/acceptance through this life stage.</p>]]></message>

<message><![CDATA[<p>Thanks Carly. Yes I agree that charting can cause more concern and I follow your philosophy on weight in pregnancy and postpartum also.</p><p>Excited about the multiple pregnancy information :)</p><p>One other question that I have (maybe an obvious one) is about vitamin K2. With the D3 &amp; K2 drops the dose is usually 1000 iu D3 and K2 around 120mcg. Would you always recommend taking a separate supplement rather than the combined ones as most women will need more D3? I hope this question makes sense?</p>]]></message>

<message><![CDATA[<p>It's really dependent on their unique needs. Many prenatal multivitamins offer some D3, but often not enough - and usually no K2. So this combo could help bump up their D3 and provide the needed K2. But if it's their only source of supplemental D3, they'll likely need an additional D3 supplement to meet their needs.</p>]]></message>

<message><![CDATA[<p>I'm seeking a little guidance on the first of my postpartum client trials... My client consumes a vegan diet and though she consumes a good amount of nutrient dense plant-based food, there's still a significant amount of nutrients that I feel she needs to supplement. I'm struggling to narrow it down to make these recommendations manageable for her. From her intake, my sense is that she feels pretty confident in her health status and nutrition knowledge, and I certainly don't want to leave her feeling overwhelmed or insulted with too many suggestions. Though I know a prenatal multivitamin is recommended for all breastfeeding mothers, I feel like for this woman, it would be most beneficial to focus on the other key nutrients that are not necessarily included or high enough in a prenatal and are lacking in a vegan diet (DHA, iron, choline, and possibly calcium) and emphasize the importance of beta carotene, calcium, and zinc through diet. Would you recommend also including a prenatal vitamin, or limit to the above? Thank you :)</p>]]></message>

<message><![CDATA[<p>Hi Amanda, it sounds as though this client is in very good hands with you. Your recommendations seem very mindful, not only of her nutritional health but also of how she may feel about any feedback you may provide. I think your idea would be wise. However, instead of leaving a prenatal multivitamin out altogether, I may suggest including the other nutrients in (DHA, iron, choline) in your primary recommendations, and then offering a secondary list of secondary supplements she can consider if not already overwhelmed with the primary recommendations. These being a prenatal multivitamin and possibly calcium. You could suggest that she maybe take the multi every other day, or even just on days she doesn't feel her diet is as nutrient-dense.  She could focus on calcium-rich plant foods, but have the supplement available for days she does't consume as many dietary sources. Of course, there are other nutrients like zinc and vitamin D that are more difficult to get through a vegan diet as well. Whatever you decide, ensure you explain all of you recommendations thoroughly so the evaluators know your line of reasoning. As you've pointed out, supplementation protocols are not one size fits all!</p>]]></message>

<message><![CDATA[<p>Hi Vivienne, great question. There are many nutrients that are not covered in the curriculum. The ones we did cover are of special importance AND there is a risk of being deficient OR there are common misconceptions about the nutrient. B6 wasn't included because it's present in many foods and deficiency is quite rare. Some people that *may* be deficient are those with liver, kidney, digestive or autoimmune diseases — but these are preexisting conditions, not pregnancy specific. That said, the RDA during pregnancy is 1.9 mg and the upper limit is 100 mg.</p>]]></message>

<message><![CDATA[<p>Hello. I have a question regarding folate and how to discuss this topic with clients. Am not sure how it is in the US or Canada, but in Europe (at least to my knowledge) few people test themselves to check for a MTHFR gene mutation. The test is also relatively expensive (or, let's say, it definitely adds up to the many prenatal tests you have ti perform). I am not sure what's the right approach between recommending a folate or a Methylfolate (MTHF) supplement to clients. Folate over folic acid is a no brainer, but I feel it might be a bit counterproductive to ask them to take this test to see if they have a gene mutation even before pregnancy (during conception). Are there any obvious / concrete sings that could point out that the client is predisposed to having a gene mutation? Any symptoms? Thank you,<br>Corina</p>]]></message>

<message><![CDATA[<p>Great question... I don't think the test is specifically necessary. I always try to remember that it's our role to provide the information and it's the client's role to decide what's best for them. So with this as an example, I would explain why folic acid is not recommended, and that methylfolate is ideal, as it's the most easily absorbed. If they're interested in taking methylfolate, maybe you could recommend a prenatal multivitamin that already includes it. Or they may just want to take it separately for the 1st trimester only. But folate could still be a good option, and certainly better than folic acid (I just updated the curriculum to reflect this).</p><p>Foundational Nutrition includes a video in module 2 labelled "ideal, best, better, base" explaining that "ideal" is not out goal for every client. Rather it's about finding what's "ideal" for them as an individual. If someone is very health focused and can't learn enough, talking to them about testing might interest them. But other clients might be overwhelmed by the idea. It's our role to feel out each person and base your recommendations around their unique needs and interests.</p>]]></message>

<message><![CDATA[<p>Hi Ainslee, I'm so sorry to learn of your losses. I don't feel that what you've been taking would have been harmful. However, now that you have new information, you are armed with the power to choose something that may be more ideal for you. While we can never know for sure, mid-line defects and lip-tongue ties can point to poor methylation of folic acid. And although miscarriages can be linked to many many different things (more than we know), they have also been linked to poor methylation of folic acid (<a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1658361217300598)" rel="nofollow noopener" title="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1658361217300598)">https://www.sciencedirect.c...</a>.</p><p>I'm not saying your supplement caused these!!! But I am saying that with your 2 known risk factors, taking a methylated folate is <i>highly</i> recommended for you. And while Foraged seems like a great quality product, it doesn't have methylated folate. So it would need to be taken in addition, along with several other nutrients that Foraged seems to be missing (DHA, vitamin D, etc).</p>]]></message>

<message><![CDATA[<p>Morning, <br>Just after some clarification. If a client is not eating enough fatty fish and is already supplementing with Rosita Cod Liver Oil. How can she best meet her Omega 3's requirements? She is wishing to fall pregnant but is also currently still breastfeeding an older child. My question is, is this brand sufficient as it has Vit D- 127IU and recommendation is 2,000 - 4,000IU and then with Omega 3's total 417mg and recommendation is 1,000mg/day. Would you suggest a different product all together?</p>]]></message>

<message><![CDATA[<p>Hi Carley!</p><p>When you say postpartum or lactating women is there a limit to when those periods end?  For example is a mother no longer postpartum after one year and lactating is it until 18 months or when a mother fully weans?  I ask this question because I am a mother of a soon to be 2 year old and I still feel postpartum in a sense and am still nursing. This always comes up with my mom friends and would love your input.</p>]]></message>

<message><![CDATA[<p>Hi Elise, generally speaking (without seeing her food journal), I'd suggest that she double her intake of Rosita, which would provide her 834mg of omega 3s and 254IU vitamin D. This would meet her needs for omega 3 (assuming she'd likely be getting *some* from diet). Then I'd suggest she take an additional vitamin D to meet her needs. Is she getting any D3 from a multivitamin? Does she eat foods that contain D3? If not, taking an additional 2,000IU would probably be appropriate.</p>]]></message>

<message><![CDATA[<p>I feel as though the concern primarily stems from "unpasteurized" being associated with high-risk foods. However, fermented foods don't carry nearly the same risk as say, unpasteurized soft cheese. During fermentation the sugars from the vegetables are converted into lactic acid, which inhibits the growth of pathogenic bacteria. Of course, with all food, ferments can "go off" but luckily, these are much more easy to spot with sight and smell than other foods. It's always up to a client's comfort level, but fermented foods offer MUCH more benefit than harm! There's a lesson on kombucha and apple cider vinegar in module 4 that goes into more of the benefit vs risk.</p>]]></message>

<message><![CDATA[<p>Choline is an interesting one as it's an "adequate Intake" vs a "recommended dietary allowance", which means that "evidence is insufficient to develop an RDA". But the AI is a suggested 450mg, and studies show that even more is shown to be beneficial. The answer here really depends on your client. Are they into and comfortable with  supplementing? Then I'd say go for it. Or are they new to it/potentially overwhelmed by it? Then I'd say 300mg/day is likely sufficient — and opt for omega 3, vitamin D, or probiotics instead. Or somewhere in the middle? Maybe they'd be ok with supplementing on days they don't eat eggs or salmon, and skipping it on days they do. Not necessarily a straight forward answer here but hopefully that gives you enough to go on ;)</p>]]></message>

Would she be willing to incorporate any other foods that contain vitamin A? This would likely be preferable to supplementing.

<message><![CDATA[<p>Hey, just a question for personal use... if a woman went into spontaneous preterm labor in their first pregnancy at 33 weeks and they were told this is most likely to reoccur if they were to fall pregnant again. Is there anything specific you would recommend to help prevent this a second time. I know there are lots of nutrients that deficiency can effect the likely hood of preterm labor but I just wanted to ask your opinion? Also if she found out she had Cholestasis the day before giving birth (had no itching but did have light coloured stools and pain near her liver)   but was told her bile salts were too low to have been the cause of the pre-term labor?</p>]]></message>

<message><![CDATA[<p>Hi Carley,</p><p>I have a question about how to support women who cannot keep food down and those with major food aversions. How do we go about offering them advice? I have seen many posts saying that they can only handle refined carbs, healthy food tastes awful, or as soon as they eat something then they vomit. Do you think this may be an a natural protective mechanism of the body?</p><p>Also, I have a question about Group B Strep. My friend is currently 14.5 weeks pregnant and they gave her a Group B Strep test and then put her on an antibiotic!!!  Also, she is scheduling a c-section which the doctors know but they guilted her anyway. Why would they do that and if this happens to a client in the future, how do we go about supporting false claims from doctors?</p><p>When offering clients the Elimination Protocol and Prophylactic Protocol in tandem, how do we guarantee that it will reduce the likelihood of GBS when they are not tested during labor? Do we let them "risk it" or can they request a test during the labor or do we need to have them sign a waiver during practice to prevent getting sued if something happens to baby and they refuse antibiotics during labor?</p><p>Thanks!</p>]]></message>

<message><![CDATA[<p>Hi Carley!</p><p>As a black woman reading about the Vitamin D and actually finding out my levels were low this truly hit close to home in an empowering way.  Now, I understand that those with darker skin tones tend to have a harder time with getting what they need from the sun.  Does this apply to those of other ethnicities who are darker skin think LatinX, Indian, Asian etc. or really more for blacks?  Next, there are so many varying degrees of skin tone, myself I am medium toned, my daughter is fair skin is there a way to break this down further because the statement and results seem very blanketed. Like for me I may need two hours of sun but my daughter who is fair would she need less?  Hopefully I am making sense!</p>]]></message>

<message><![CDATA[<p>Hi Jade, I'm so glad to hear you found this information empowering. This will apply to other ethnicities as well, in varying degrees according to the shade of their skin tone. As for how much sun exposure would be required to meet someone's needs for vitamin D — the darker the skin tone, the more time they would need in the sun. Interestingly, this is true for natural skin tones AND skin that has darkened from the sun. For example, if a South Asian women has a medium skin tone, then her skin darkens in the sun — as it gets darker, the increased pigment reduces the skin's ability to produce vitamin D.</p>]]></message>

<message><![CDATA[<p>1. With food aversions, you can help to see if the client is experiencing any nutritional gaps from the aversions they're having — and make recommendations to fill these when and where they're appropriate. As for cravings, often "strict avoidance" only makes cravings more intense. So telling the client that it's okay to fit these cravings into an otherwise nutrient-dense diet. Are there "healthy" versions of their cravings they can fulfill? Try to increase protein intake for sugar cravings to ensure that blood sugar remains balanced. Don't get too hungry, as cravings will intensify.</p><p>2. Wow! So shocked by this. I'd empower the client with the knowledge that nutrition &amp; lifestyle changes can greatly impact one's GBS status. Encourage her to talk with her care provider about making changes before taking antibiotics. As GBS is passed to baby during birth, I really don't see a need to take antibiotics so early in pregnancy! What a shame.</p><p>3. While this protocol has a high success rate, we absolutely can't guarantee that it will change her status. This protocol is meant to be followed in the hopes of the mother retesting again before the onset of labor.</p>]]></message>

<message><![CDATA[<p>Thank you for your reply.<br>Yes she is getting Vit D3 through her multivitamin- (Colecalciferol equiv vit D3 1000IU OR 25mcg, which is not in a softigel). Yes she has some Vit D3 through diet. Eats salmon once a week sometimes twice. I will then suggest taking an additional Vit D3 supplement, perhaps in a more available source at 2,000 IU and suggest increase intake of the Rosita. <br>Thank-you!</p>]]></message>

<message><![CDATA[<p>Vitamin A is a but tricky because the lowest risk is beta carotene, however, it's the least absorbable. The best quality and most absorbable is active, preformed vitamin A from animal foods. This can be found in a standalone supplements, but I've yet to see it in a prenatal multivitamin. Most prenatal multis contain ester forms of retinol, such as retinyl palmitate or retinyl acetate. So in some regards, you're limited to what the prenatal multi contains.</p>]]></message>

<message><![CDATA[<p>Hi there, <br>I have a question regarding formula. My client, who is breastfeeding, has been alerted by her pediatrician that her baby is a little bit underweight (he is 3 months old - before it was all good), so she wants to complete with formulas, but the baby does not want to take the bottle. Any recommendations on that? I remembered my midwife telling me that if we want to complete with a bottle, it should be the other partner doing it to avoid any confusion on the baby's side. Do you have any other tips? <br>In addition, is it possible that all her milk supply is not enough now? I guess it can be due to stress, fatigue..can I recommend her to pump her milk often times to stimulate the production? <br>Thank you so much for your help - appreciate it, <br>Séverine</p>]]></message>

<message><![CDATA[<p>Hi Séverine, this can be a very tricky situation. Often times, pediatricians want all baby to fit perfectly within the parameters of a chart. Except, some perfectly healthy babies can be a "little bit" underweight without any cause for concern. Statements like this frequently cause a mother to second guess her supply and question if she's able to provide enough to meet her baby's needs. Also, topping up with formula often leads to less breastfeeding over time, which then in turn does lower a mother's supply. A self fulfilling prophecy.</p><p>First and foremost, we can't advise a client to go against their doctor's recommendations. But we can talk to them about how they're feeling and encourage them to discuss alternate options with their doctor. For instance, how do you feel? Do you think your baby is healthy and thriving, or do you have concerns over his weight gain and/or your supply. Maybe you can...<br>- Talk your doctor about increasing your supply and weighing baby again before starting formula?<br>- Pump and feed pumped bottles as top ups?<br>- Offer baby to breastfeed more often? (Are they breastfeeding on demand or with a schedule?)</p><p>I wish these were always a pediatricians *first* recommendations, but unfortunately it seems that a mother has to be proactive herself for this type of care.</p><p>If your client was wanting to try formula, it would be best if a partner could initiate this until baby becomes comfortable with a bottle.</p>]]></message>

<message><![CDATA[<p>Hi,<br>For the client trial based on baby intending to start solids between 4-6 months: I have a volunteer with a recently turned 4 month old baby. She intends to start solids at 5 months. (not aware of her reasons for the same yet.)<br>I was a little confused about whether this baby can be taken as a volunteer for my trial. There is a possibility that the baby is not ready and perhaps the mother is misinformed about the concept of starting solids.<br>In such a case, will this work as a volunteer trial?</p><p>I do have in mind how I can use my skills as a Baby Nutrition Consultant to help her understand the needful if this case would be acceptable for submission.</p><p>Thanks!!</p>]]></message>

<message><![CDATA[<p>This is actually something I've been trying to get a clear answer on for a while. <br>I know formaldehyde is used the production of other folates, such as Calcium l‐methylfolate. One one hand, the chemical formaldehyde is "natural" in that it's naturally occurring in various foods like many fruits, vegetables, meats, and seafood. Humans even produce it naturally, and it’s a necessary part of different biological functions. However, it's obviously dangerous at certain levels. We know that residual quantities of formaldehyde are found in several vaccines. But it's been terribly challenging trying to gain clarity on how this impacts the end result supplement. Sorry I don't have a more definitive answer for you! Something I'm curious about myself as well.</p>]]></message>

<message><![CDATA[<p>It would just depend on the reason why the tea is not tolerated. Is it the taste? Then yes, a supplement would be a great alternative. Or she could try mixing the tea with another stronger tasting tea that she enjoys. But if it's due to a certain symptom or "aggressive" braxton hicks, then I would just skip it all together.</p><p>As for dosage, I would just recommend following the label dose recommendation as it would depend on the supplement type (supplement or tincture etc.).

<message><![CDATA[<p>Hi Heidi, this is a question that come up often. Unfortunately, there really isn't one simple resource that I'm familiar with. The very broad answer is that "all" nutrients impact other nutrients. It's really a chain reaction though the whole body. But there are some are much more direct interactions (as in your example).</p><p>I'm sure you've seen the video in Foundational Nutrition module 2 "The tandem relationship of nutrients". It's a very basic introduction to the concept.</p><p>I did also find these blog posts <a href="https://omexcanada.com/plant-nutrition/relationship-between-nutrients" rel="nofollow noopener" title="https://omexcanada.com/plant-nutrition/relationship-between-nutrients">https://omexcanada.com/plan...</a> but they go into some nutrients that aren't covered in our courses. A more involved understanding would require becoming a nutritionist, as it's beyond the scope of this program.</p>]]></message>

<message><![CDATA[<p>Thank you! Do you think that early pregnancy tests for homocysteine and MTHFR would be beneficial for those women who are attempting to conceive or have conceived and have previously suffered from PE,PA,PPD, miscarriage, infertility and GD? I read this article that woman who suffer from those conditions typically have elevated homocysteine. Other tests were recommended such as B12, folate, hsCRP, and hgA1C as indicators to possibly preventing these pregnancy conditions. I understand that those conditions can arise from different circumstances, however, they most always occur from inflammation. Also, I read that homocysteine is found elevated 1-2 days postpartum and 6 weeks after delivery. Why do you think this is?</p>]]></message>

<message><![CDATA[<p>Yes, while not standard, I do think it could be beneficial. Given that the results allowed the mother to be properly supported by her practitioners, which is not likely to be the case if an OB was ordering these test, as it's generally not their specialty. It would be best if the mother worked with an ND or functional practitioner.</p><p>As you mentioned, these conditions do arise from inflammation (when partnered with other risk factors). Which is also the case for so many others outside of pregnancy, such as heart disease for example. High homocysteine usually indicates a deficiency in vitamin B-12 or folate, hsCRP is a marker of systemic inflammation, and we discuss hgA1C is in module 3 in relation to GD.</p><p>As for homocysteine being found elevated 1-2 days postpartum and 6 week. It's not that homocysteine 'spiked' at these times. This stems from a study that was done where the participants were only evaluated at these two times after the delivery.</p>]]></message>

<message><![CDATA[<p>It's not really a clear cut answer with arnica. There are reports that arnica infusions and tinctures have led to miscarriage, and the FDA classifies it as unsafe for pregnancy. Personally I do feel that occasional topical homeopathic preparations likely present a low risk. However, I don't feel comfortable stating that as an absolute. Also, as a disclaimer, I'm not trained in homeopathics and as such, I usually only stick to the homeopathic recommendations that are well studied.</p>]]></message>

<message><![CDATA[<p>I have a client who has celiac and is also border line anemic. Her iron levels are low but she doesn't want to continue to take an iron supplement as she is feeling uncomfortably constipated. I am recommending her switch her iron supplement from ferrous fumarate to bisglycinate to help with that. However, assuming she will still not want to take that I was going to also recommend taking a liver capsule as an alternative to get her iron intake. My question is, how much should she take if each capsule has 750 mg of beef liver in it? <br>Also, what hidden additives should I look for in capsules and supplements that would not be celiac friendly?</p>]]></message>

<message><![CDATA[<p>Making that suggested switch should help! Along with the recommendations in the constipation protocol (module 3). Desiccated liver pills frequently don't have nutritional info on the label because it often varies and they can't guarantee nutritional consistency from batch to batch or pill to pill. Due to this, it can be difficult to use them in cases such as anemia when a more regulated dose is preferred. It can be great in addition to other supplementation though. Hopefully she'll feel comfortable trying your suggested switch.</p>]]></message>

<message><![CDATA[<p>Hello! I am feeling really confused about Vitamin A. it says that the recommended daily intake is 770 mcg RAE (2,566IU) and that the upper tolerable intake is 3,000 mcg RAE, or 10,000 IU.   I am looking an a pregnancy nutrition book "Real Food for Pregnancy" and her meal plans average at: Vitamin A &gt; 13,935mcg / Retinol &gt; 2,492 mcg. <br>My first question is: The Vitamin A would include active and inactive form, whereas the Retinol would be the active form, right?<br>my second question is: Would 2,492mcg of Retinol be safe in pregnancy? it falls within the Upper Tolerable Intakes, but should we only recommend up to 770 mcg RAE?<br>I hope this all makes sense! I've read so many things now, I've completely confused myself. <br>I'd appreciate any help. <br>Thank you</p><p>Leanne</p>]]></message>

<message><![CDATA[<p>Hi Jorgia, we do cover thyroid conditions in postpartum as they are much more common during that period. As for this client, is her hyperthyroidism preexisting (did she have it before pregnancy) or was it brought on by pregnancy? If it's preexisting, I encourage you to review the video lesson at the end of module 3 titled supporting Autoimmune Conditions. One thing to confirm with this client though.... synthetic thyroxine (levothyroxine or synthroid) is usually used for hypothyroidism. Is she taking it to treat hyperthyroidism?</p>]]></message>

<message><![CDATA[<p>Hi Leanne, thanks for notifying us about the broken links. We'll look into that right away. As for your two suggestions, they're both fantastic! If she is taking these after antibiotics, then Genestra HMF Replete is also a great recommendation as it's formulated to specifically support post-ABX. While these aren't the cheapest options, they aren't the least expensive either. Hopefully you can share the value of investing to replete her beneficial bacteria during pregnancy.</p>]]></message>

<message><![CDATA[<p>Hi Jorgia, there isn't anything in particular we can recommend for cherry moles. It's actually not uncommon for changes in skin to occur during pregnancy. While melasma is most common, skin tags and moles can occur as well. The only suggestion would be to advise that she see a dermatologist. It's very likely that there is no reason for concern but it's always beneficial to have a professional eye on new/changing moles.</p><p>As for nosebleeds, this is due to an increase in blood volume. This article sums it up well. <a href="https://utswmed.org/medblog/nosebleeds-during-pregnancy/" rel="nofollow noopener" title="https://utswmed.org/medblog/nosebleeds-during-pregnancy/">https://utswmed.org/medblog...</a> I would add a focus on iron rich foods if she is loosing blood regularly. As well as vitamin K1 (leafy greens) to assist with clotting.</p><p>Formulas are covered in the Postpartum Nutrition course, module 5. Unfortunately there aren't any dairy-free and soy-free formulas that we recommend. Donor milk is the ideal choice, after that higher quality brands such as Hipp or Holle are best. I'd also suggest that she secure a reliable IBCLC to have on call to support with breastfeeding if needed during the early days.</p>]]></message>

<message><![CDATA[<p>Hi! <br>I'm in a parent support group and yesterday a mother was recommending this salmon fish oil (<a href="https://www.nefful.com.sg/products/ne022-100-salmon-fish-oil/)" rel="nofollow noopener" title="https://www.nefful.com.sg/products/ne022-100-salmon-fish-oil/)">https://www.nefful.com.sg/p...</a> due to its "freshness" and lack of fishy smell and flavour. I started reading about salmon farmed in Norway and I read that "vegetable oil, vegetable proteins and carbohydrates constitute around 70% of the salmon feed" - would the vegetable oils in their diet affect the lipid profile of the oil they produce? On the website selling the oils, there isn't much information on it at all about the levels of DHA and EPA. Any insight?</p>]]></message>

<message><![CDATA[<p>Hi Carley,</p><p>I've got a question regarding whole oats groats vs. rolled or quick-cooking. Are the whole oats preferred because of the nutrients contained within being "fresher" than in their more processed counterparts? I was under the impression that rolled or quick-cooking (not instant!) were just ground finer and only made a difference in texture/cooking time. I personally sour rolled oats overnight before cooking, as I prefer the texture. But am wondering what exactly would make them less desirable than the whole groats! (Hadn't even thought about it before, but now all I can think of is it's like grinding your own flour?)</p><p>Thanks!<br>anja</p>]]></message>

<message><![CDATA[<p>Generally speaking I much prefer fish oil from wild fish, both from a nutritional and environmental perspective. The diet of the fish can greatly impact their lipid profile. If you wanted to dig deeper, you could contact the company to inquire about their products DHA/EPA content. However, I'd still stick with recommending a product sourced from wild fish.</p>]]></message>

<message><![CDATA[<p>Hi Anja, steel cut are preferred primarily due to the rate at which they're digested. The more whole the oats are, the longer it takes for the starch to turn to sugar. This helps someone stay fuller for longer and reduces blood sugar irregularities. That said, rolled oats are still great! Especially when soured and even more so when paired with protein and healthy fat.</p>]]></message>

<message><![CDATA[<p>There is a bit on teas in the lesson "Herbs &amp; Essential Oils" in this module. Any of the herbs listed to avoid would also be applicable in tea form too. Herbs are difficult to go into great depths about as a) there aren't sufficient studies in pregnancy b) herbs are very complex and would really require further education in herbalism. I'm not an herbalist myself but have the basics, which are shared her and peppered throughout the curriculum.</p>]]></message>

<message><![CDATA[<p>You mentioned kidney stones in the supporting autoimmune conditions video and I was wondering what you found. I have a friend who got kidney stones in both of her pregnancies (she had her second baby a month early because of them) and was told by her dietician to cut out almost all protein, oxalates, dairy and more. At the time I didn't feel comfortable suggesting anything different but I've been thinking about it a lot while going through this course. Would suggesting foods with bioavailable K2 or a K2 supplement be appropriate, or is that too simplistic?</p>]]></message>

<message><![CDATA[<p>Hi Theresa, firstly let me say that I'm not *extremely* well-versed in toxoplasmosis infections in other animals. From my current understanding, I believe that....<br>cats are the ONLY known animal where the T. gondii parasite infects the intestinal lining where they rapidly multiple and are then excreted in the cat’s feces. Infections in other animals happen in the lymph and blood to invade other parts of the body. As such, chicken feces would NOT be considered a risk of toxoplasma gondii. However, raw meat would be — and raw meat (esp poultry) is highly advised against during pregnancy. The biggest consideration of having a backyard or small scale coop is when there are also cats on the premises or in the neighborhood. More cats = more risk of chicken meat that contains T. gondii. So stringent washing of surfaces that come in contact with raw meat is imperative. Also washing produce from the backyard if potentially infected cats roam the gardens.</p>]]></message>

<message><![CDATA[<p>There's a real lack of knowledge and research around naturally supporting kidney stones during pregnancy. While I would be very hesitant to tell someone who is pregnant to avoid protein completely, I would encourage them to consume protein with ample amounts of alkaline foods. This helps to reduce the amount of calcium the kidneys excrete. High oxalate foods are indeed recommended to be mindful of if experiencing kidney stones.</p><p>A few other recommendations:<br>- increase water consumption <br>- if supplementing with calcium, try a food-based supplement to help with assimilation <br>- magnesium and potassium rich foods can help balance calcium levels<br>- adequate K2 and D3 <br>- ACV <br>- dandelion root tea/tincture <br>- electrolyte supplement</p><p>Reduce:<br>- white sugar and processed grains, which increase acidity and cause the body to excrete calcium</p><p>The recommendations in the UTI protocol can also be helpful!</p>]]></message>

The only consideration (which may be obvious, but I'll say it anyways) is that while jackfruit is a popular meat substitution, it isn't a nutritional equivalent. It would just be considered as any other fruit would be in the meal.</p>]]></message>

<message><![CDATA[<p>Hi Carley,<br>I am in the process of completing my final client trial and my client is on an antidepressant medication and when researching the medication I found that some of her 'postpartum symptoms' are listed side effects of the medication. I was also looking into drug induced nutrient deficancy and found that Melatonin, Folic Acid and Sodium are the main nutrients used in the chemical interaction with the body and could lead to depletion. This makes sense as my client has constant headaches and terrible sleep issues. Am I making this more complicated than it needs to be? I don't want to disregard her medication in my trial assessment but I also want to make sure I am working within my scope of practice. Would you suggest this client take Melatonin supplementation and if so, is there a brand you would recommend? Thanks, Leila</p>]]></message>

<message><![CDATA[<p>Hi Leila, It's great to hear that you're being so proactive with this client and thinking about how her medication may be impacting her nutritional needs. Generally speaking, advising on prescriptions and possible interactions/deficiencies they may cause is out of our scope of practice. That said, looking into a client's medication, as you've done, can offer us some incredible insight. At this point it would be about how you approach this topic. Instead of saying "I googled and saw that this medication can cause XYZ — here's how to support that", it's best to say "While I'm not entirely well versed in prescriptions, I do believe that your prescription may lead to XYZ. I'm inclined to suggest {these recommendations} but advise you to consult with your prescribing physician before implementing them."</p><p>As for melatonin, is she breastfeeding? Melatonin supplementation for short-term in the evening is thought to be considered low-risk for a nursing baby. But as there’s not enough research, it's generally not recommended for breastfeeding mothers. Again, this is something you'd recommend they discuss with their prescribing physician.</p>]]></message>

<message><![CDATA[<p>Hi Carley <br>Thanks so much for getting back to me so quickly.<br>I used this website to research her medication. <a href="https://mytavin.com/results/medications/148" rel="nofollow noopener" title="https://mytavin.com/results/medications/148">https://mytavin.com/results...</a> <br>it also provides some medical journal references. I wondered what your thoughts were on using this website? Like you said I didn't just want to google it but I had also never heard of the medication. She has also rated sleep as 1 out of 5 and stress as 5 out of 5 and I know melatonin could potentially assist with both of these so I will suggest she speaks to a qualified health professional.</p><p>My client is drinking lots of water but her main concern are the headaches. She is still breastfeeding her 9month old several times a day. I am yet to have our consultation so I will be diving deeper into details with my questions. If the frequent headaches aren't medication related, what would you suggest for a 9 month PP mother who is experiencing this. I was maybe thinking that just water might not be hydrating her (potentially do to her medication) and so suggesting she add some lime and Celtic salt to her water. As headaches aren't included in the oh baby postpartum conditions. Are there any other suggestions you would make other than magnesium supplementation?</p><p>Leila</p>]]></message>

<message><![CDATA[<p>It'm sorry about your friend's loss. Are you asking why women are given the shot at 28 weeks, or why it's standard of care to be given a shot after a miscarriage when Rh-negative? This is to prevent the formation of antibodies which can occur late in pregnancy, during birth or a miscarriage. This lessens the risk in future pregnancies. <br>I like this article on the topic: <a href="https://www.verywellfamily.com/can-being-rh-negative-cause-a-miscarriage-2371474" rel="nofollow noopener" title="https://www.verywellfamily.com/can-being-rh-negative-cause-a-miscarriage-2371474">https://www.verywellfamily....</a></p>]]></message>

For example, if a baby has eczema, have the mother go through the elimination diet for eczema to see if her baby's symptoms improve? I know you stated in Postpartum Nutrition that it only takes 1-2 weeks for the proteins to no longer be present in a mother's milk. Thank you!</p>]]></message>

<message><![CDATA[<p>Hi Mackenna, it is much more difficult to do an effective elimination diet through a breastfeeding mother alone. If doing this, I would recommend only doing ONE food at a time because it would be too restrictive to try to remove them all and then add them back in one at a time. More anecdotally, some mothers do say they notice improvements by removing dairy from their own diet. So that would be the place to start. I would recommend probiotics for mother and baby. Fish oil for the mother too can be beneficial.</p>]]></message>

<message><![CDATA[<p>Hi Leanne, I might guess that you are referring to Ferapro 150? I really love that this brand also includes methylated B9 &amp; B12. When it comes to iron specifically, there are a few reasons why these forms are used. In Canada, we aren't able to get a dose as high as 150mg over the counter — our max is 35mg. So when a client needs such a high dose, these would be described by a doctor. I talk about why doctors might prescribe certain forms of nutrients in a video included in module 2 "Doctor Prescribed Vitamins". As a dose this high dose is prescription only, we really only see forms that are more typically used by allopathic doctors.</p><p>When we're talking about the *average supplement user* (who doesn't require such a high dose and can be more choosy is selection and budget allow), there are just other forms I tend to prefer more for the reasons described in the learning material. Such as natural sources of vitamin C vs ascorbic acid, which is synthetic and usually sourced from GMO corn.</p><p>But I would never advise against the one you highlight at all! If she (or anyone) is taking such a high dose, there's obviously a great need for it. It's great that this supplement gets such high reviews and that it's working well for your volunteer client!</p>]]></message>

<message><![CDATA[<p>Hi Cesca, no need to excuse the pun. It's one of the most popular ones in the nutrition realm for good reason ;) I'm so glad you're reaching out for further clarity. Your chart is impressive and it looks great, but I can also see why you might be getting confused. While I applaud your efforts to be thorough, you may be making it more complicated than you need to.</p><p>Technically speaking, (as an example) rice is both a grain and a seed. The rice kernel is the "seed" of the grass, but rice itself is known as a grain. And while tree nuts are *technically* the seed of a tree, calling them a seed would surely confuse people.  Peanuts are also technically a legume.</p><p>I really never ever hear any nutritionists or dietitians use types or sub-types. For simplicities sake, they're always simply categorized as:<br>Squash &amp; root veg (as you have)<br>Grains: rice, wheat, spelt (all cereal/bread grains etc)<br>Psuedo-grains: buckwheat, quinoa, etc<br>Beans &amp; legumes: chickpeas, lentils, black beans, etc<br>Nuts &amp; seeds: almonds, pumpkin seed, hemp seed, etc</p><p>By sticking with those primary categories, I'm confident that you'll keep things easier for yourself and your clients.</p>]]></message>

<message><![CDATA[<p>Hi Carly,</p><p>I'm prepping for a client trial and the client's baby had intense reflux and although breastfeeding to begin with, she eventually began including formula at around 3 months and after milk supply dwindling, she is now mostly consuming formula. Her doctor recommended she try adding carob [anti-reflux] gel to milk and she said this helped her daughter tremendously to keep the milk down. I had never heard of carob gel being used as a thickening agent and wondered what your thoughts about it were and if there is anything I should be particularly mindful of when supporting the journey in starting solids for a baby that has had reflux and already been consuming this carob gel. Her doctor has also advised her to introduce solids slightly early at 5.5 months.</p><p>Any thoughts you could share would be appreciated :)</p><p>Thank you!</p>]]></message>

<message><![CDATA[<p>Thank you so much for this simplification. I was worried about getting 'caught out' as a novice, but it's reassuring to hear that the technicalities of these categories aren't so important and I'll focus on those broader categories and avoid getting into a pickle! I've learnt a lot anyhow so it's been a useful exercise. I appreciate the help, thanks.</p>]]></message>

<message><![CDATA[<p>Hi Carley,</p><p>a question that came up for me as I came across the 'beverage section' on the food guide...</p><p>of course fresh pressed juice made at home is ideal, but not always an option for all.  the reason we should favor homemade juices over anything else is due to the fact that all fiber and nutrients remain in tact, compared to the juice on the shelves at grocery stores, that are either pasteurized or packed with added sugar/preservatives.</p><p>what then would you consider for pregnant women, who don't have access to a juicer at home, and are advised of course to consume only pasteurized juice? Is it worth consuming say pasteurized orange juice, as all that really remains is a nutrient void liquid, highly concentrated in sugar??  surely it's not ideal for mama's blood sugar + baby? so my question then is, what about pasteurized orange juice that is fortified with calcium and vitamin D?  what are your thoughts on pasteurized juice that is fortified with these nutrients?  will our bodies process these the same way?  is it necessarily bad?</p><p>super curious!</p>]]></message>

A few suggestions — try refreshing your page, and also try enlarging the view window, which is down using the 2 arrows in the top right corner on the assignment page.

<message><![CDATA[<p>FOUR HUNDRED DOLLARS?! Did you add an extra zero by mistake?? Holy geeze that's wild!</p><p>A few things... transdermal magnesium is typically magnesium chloride. While all magnesium can support elimination, it's magnesium citrate that's known to be most effective.</p><p>Secondly, many people find transdermal magnesium uncomfortable on their skin. It can sort of sting/burn a little for some. While an adult can likely take this "knowing" what it's for, I would't want to chance this on the sensitive skin of a baby.</p><p>An alternate would be to use any magnesium citrate tablet and crush it using a mortal &amp; pestle. It would have to be mindfully dosed to weight (label = 150lb adult, so adjust for baby). Or if you have access to magnesium citrate capsules. Again, open and adjust for weight — add to a small puree.</p>]]></message>

<message><![CDATA[<p>Hi everyone. I have a question. Seeing as pasteurization creates issues with milk and the digestion of it, what are your recommendations? In Croatia there are strict guidelines against unpasteurized milk, especially in pregnancy, due to the risk of listeria infection. It seems that there isn't really a good middle ground. Thank you in advance!</p>]]></message>

<message><![CDATA[<p>The risks associated with unpasteurized milk are discussed in much greater length in Pregnancy, module 4. In Canada, where I live, raw milk is actually illegal to purchase as well. Even privately direct from the farmer. so it would really depend on someone's potential level of sensitivity. If it was well tolerated, organic grass-fed could be an option. In the Baby course we discuss this (sensitivity and alternate options) in much greater length in modules 3 &amp; 4.</p>]]></message>

<message><![CDATA[<p>Hi Emma, Great question. This would really depend on a mother's blood sugar regulation. Orange juice in particular is a major hit of sugar with none of things that slow down the spike down (fat, fiber, protein). She *may* be able to tolerate a small glass with a fully balanced meal. But definitely not if she has gestational diabetes. We talk a lot more about the risks of unpasteurized products in Pregnancy module 4. We also discuss maternal blood sugar in Pregnancy modules 3 &amp; 4.</p><p>Typically speaking, fortified foods in general are not preferable as they generally use the lowest quality (read - cheapest) form of the nutrient. So many better and more bioavailable ways to get calcium and vitamin D - both of which require a source of fat to be absorbed. In Pregnancy module 1 &amp; 2 we discuss the different forms of supplements and what's ideal.</p>]]></message>

Although, there have been reports of some adverse effects in premature babies. Therefore, carob gel is only recommended for babies born at term.</p><p>As for additional support, I would highly recommend probiotics for this baby. If they haven't started solids yet, I would also review the developmental signs of readiness to help them decide when the best time for introduction is.</p>]]></message>

However, recently I was reading a book (written by our famous pediatric gastroenterologist and a dietitian) where it was recommended that it would be best to avoid unpasteurized juices as there is a great risk of presence of some harmful bacteria.

<message><![CDATA[<p>Hi Carly,<br>I would like to clarify a section in how the maternal diet affects breastfeeding please. When you mention protein in the maternal diet and how it may contribute to a fussy, colicky baby, are you referring to dairy and milk proteins or to proteins in general? I read the attached study but I still couldn't seem to clarify this for myself. If this is referring to milk proteins that makes sense, but if it's protein in general how would one eliminate this out of the diet?<br>Thank you</p>]]></message>

<message><![CDATA[<p>Hi Carley, I have a question regarding foods to help support baby's nutritional requirements for an 18month old baby for my eczema protocol client trial. Am i referring to the same list of nutrients as starting solids, or are we referring to the nutrients discussed in the gut support protocol? From the food journal, it appears that this baby could use support in both areas, but I wanted to make sure I'm including the correct info, since the starting solids list refers mostly to babies at age 6 and the requirements might have changed  by the time they're 18 months.</p>]]></message>

<message><![CDATA[<p>I love that you caught this! Calcium and magnesium and interesting in that they work together — but they can also antagonize each other. Studies have found that calcium competes with magnesium for intestinal absorption. However, this happens when calcium intake is much higher than magnesium intake. Therefore balance is key, with adequate intake of magnesium for optimal physiological function.</p>]]></message>

<message><![CDATA[<p>Such a great question! I believe that wild game is the most preferable source of meat whenever it is accessible to you. When consuming wild game, we're avoiding the antibiotics and growth hormones, with a lighter impact on the planet. Not to mention that the animals are living in their natural habitat, eating/moving as intended. While wild game may consume grain some of the time, they're likely also grazing on much more variety than a factory farmed animal. For instance, deer would also feed on leaves, twigs, weeds, grasses, nuts, fruits, and mushrooms. And while canola oil isn't recommended for humans, the primary concern is that the processing (heating) of the oil oxidizes the sensitive omega 6s, which is obviously not a concern when the plant is eaten raw. It's true that almost all of the canola grown in Canada is genetically modified (not awesome), but there is really only so much we can control.</p>]]></message>

<message><![CDATA[<p>Ah... the highly debated question. You will hear people promoting both sides, and there are potential benefits and drawbacks to both. Most commonly it's recommended to drain and rinse after soaking. Benefits are that the excess phytic acid is discarded. Drawbacks are that (if you are cooking rolled oats in particular), it's highly likely that they will have soaked up most (if not all) of the liquid. Then it can be difficult to gauge how much liquid to add when cooking. This is less of a concern for whole/hard grains. I do prefer to drain and rinse as much as possible.</p><p>As for adding an acidic ingredient to the soak water, this helps to facilitate the release of phytase and the break down of phytic acid. Sometimes the acid makes the grains gooey and difficult to drain though. Ether way, soaking is still beneficial!</p>]]></message>

Interestingly, the (American) RDAs for a non-pregnant, non-lactating woman are set at 1000mg calcium and 310mg magnesium. While my liability insurance restricts me from advising clients and instructing students above the RDAs set by the government, I can certainly say something like... "The currently recommended RDAs are XYZ, but research is showing that a 2:1 and even possibly a 1:1 ratio may be more beneficial for the following reasons..."

<message><![CDATA[<p>By that I meant that the seasonal fruits that are grown in the summer in Canada, such as cherries and apples, would be seasonal to Canada *in the summer*. So yes, eating locally/seasonally would be eating what grows in your geographical area in that particular season — not just during the summer time. Full transparency, I definitely buy and consume foods that are <i>not</i> local to me (coconut oil and avocados to name a few) but I do try to let it guide my food choices in a more overarching way.</p>]]></message>

<message><![CDATA[<p>This is sort of a give and take. Raw egg yolks can be higher in some of the heat sensitive nutrients and antioxidants. But raw egg whites contain a protein called avidin, which can reduce biotin absorption — and cooking deactivates the avidin. Overall cooking at a high heat for a long period of time is least advisable. But that said, I think it's best to eat eggs how you like them. I love a soft yolk with a crispy white edge.</p>]]></message>

<message><![CDATA[<p>Question regarding industrial seed oils - I occasionally see "expeller pressed" canola or other seed oils listed as an ingredient on some of the "healthier" snack foods out there. My assumption is that this is supposed to be a healthier way to process the seed so you are not damaging the oil as much or subjecting them to chemicals. Is this correct?. If so, does this truly alleviate any health concerns or is it just good marketing? Also wondering what the term high oleic means in reference to these oils and if it has any increased health benefit compared to just standard seed oils?</p>]]></message>

<message><![CDATA[<p>Hi all, wondering about the distinction between wild and wild caught fish.  In the food quality pdf it indicates that wild caught means fish have been at least partially farm raised, then released into the wild and caught later.  Is this true universally?  I'm not sure I've ever seen seafood available in stores listed as "wild" only, so wondering if every time I've purchased wild caught it was really partially farmed and later caught.  Thanks!</p>]]></message>

<message><![CDATA[<p>Hello!  I have a question regarding Vitamin D absorption.  I was totally fascinated by the video you shared about "the tandem relationship of nutrients" and the interdependent relationship between Fat, Vitamin D3 and Cholesterol.</p><p>At the beginning of my pregnancy my midwife advised me to take a Vitamin D3 supplement (as I was deficient) alongside a meal containing good fats as well as supplementing Magnesium, as it helps facilitate Vitamin D absorption.  I was surprised that I haven't seen Magnesium mentioned alongside D3 in this Module yet because of what she told me, but after watching this video, it has me thinking... would this mean that Magnesium is a cofactor for the enzymes that are metabolizing D3?  Hopefully I'm articulating this in a way that makes sense !</p>]]></message>

I find that it really tends to cause gas and bloating in many people — even those who usually tolerate dairy well. It can contribute to constipation (or even loose stools) as well.

Even alternating with a hemp protein — it has a lower protein content, but with less digestive upset.

<message><![CDATA[<p>Sorry to hear that your little one had a reaction. However, great to hear that your doctor is thinking outside of the box. I'm guessing it's an ND or functional doctor? So most foods have aspects that are beneficial and also aspects that can be potentially problematic for some people. Both natural and synthetic forms of salicylates can cause adverse reactions in some people. There are no laboratory test for salicylate sensitivity. Testing is simply achieved though an elimination/provocative challenge. I'd be sure to work with an allergist/specialist on this. I'm sure your doctor has considered this, but oral allergy syndrome is another consideration with peaches. Peaches are included in birch pollen allergies, grass pollen allergies, and stone fruit allergies.</p>]]></message>

<message><![CDATA[<p>This can actually get really tricky. I just updated this section in the curriculum to try and provide more clarity. The fish that are partially farm raised, then released into the wild and caught are called "stocked" fish. Sometimes referred to as wild-caught, but the distinction between wild and wld-caught is NOT strictly adhered to. In truth, stocked fish are also always labelled as "wild" as well. So we wouldn't be able to differentiate as consumers. The only chance we'd have is to buy directly from the fishermen or a sustainably minded fishmonger who knows their product well. That said, looking for the label wild (or wild-caught) is our best bet.</p>]]></message>

<message><![CDATA[<p>Hi Ana, it's great that you're thinking about this. It's actually inspired me to add this information to the curriculum. As a short answer for now, as you've identified, Teflon (especially when chipped/cracking) is very concerning due to its plastic polymer (among others) that starts leaching toxins when heated. I recommend cast iron in its place. I'm also concerned about aluminum pots and recommend stainless steel in its place. And as you've identified, ceramic coating should also be avoided when possible due to potential contaminates.</p>]]></message>

<message><![CDATA[<p>During expeller pressing, the intense friction and pressure created a heat to around 140-210˚. Whereas, with a cold pressed oil, the heat is usually around 122˚, so cold pressed oils are actually preferable. That said, seed oils contain high amounts of unsaturated fatty acids that are very sensitive - and prone to oxidizing when exposed to any heat, light and oxygen. Therefore, they are not ideal cooking oils. More on that in module 2!</p>]]></message>

<message><![CDATA[<p>Smoke points can often cause confusion. The definition of smoke point is the temperature at which a fat/oil begins to burn and smoke. This is also the point where the oil changes to an unpleasant flavor. This is important to chefs who want to cook certain foods quickly at higher temperatures without having an “off” flavor. This makes sense in the culinary world where flavor, not nutrition, is the primary focus.</p><p>However, smoke point doesn't determine how well an oil can withstand high heat before becoming <i>oxidized.</i> So when considering health, knowing how sensitive a fat is to becoming oxidized should be the primary consideration — not the smoke point.</p>]]></message>

<message><![CDATA[<p>Hi Jade... for now, the RDA for magnesium is the same for all forms. This is starting to change for some nutrients (like vitamin A) as different forms are more/less bioavailable. However, at this time the RDA in postpartum for all magnesium is 355 mg/day. Just watch for bowel tolerance if going higher than that with magnesium citrate, as it draws water into the bowels and can produce loose stools.</p>]]></message>

<message><![CDATA[<p>Hi Jade, these could both be great options. I've yet to see a "perfect prenatal" and even with the top tier there are positives and some potential shortcomings. Both of these liquids include some high quality nutrients. I love the algae calcium in the Green Peach. And I'm surprised they needed an ascorbic acid in a whole foods formula. I'd be curious if the "folic acid" really is folic acid, or if it's actually natural folate that has been listed as folic acid due to the new DFE regulations. Liquids are easy to digest and usually quite bioavailable. I don't love that they have to include preservatives (to prevent bacteria) but it's a trade off for some of the other benefits.</p>]]></message>

I've probably missed something quite obvious, it's that time of the day ;-) Thanks!</p>]]></message>

<message><![CDATA[<p>I have a question... on the food quality guide. While I totally agree that quality is super important and the more we demand better quality and sustainability in our animal products the better, I would still rather have a client eat a conventional egg than no egg at all. Wouldn't we say so?? Eggs are so important. It was just a bit jarring to see it as flat out "avoid". Just thinking of those who are budget conscious getting them to get on board with whole food eating.</p>]]></message>

On a related note, do you have a sense for how much time will be required of volunteer clients to complete the forms and do the consult with us? Is 2-3 hours total an accurate estimate? I'd love to give my volunteer a sense for how much time I'll need from them to do everything.  Thanks!</p>]]></message>

<message><![CDATA[<p>Hi @carleymendes:disqus please could you confirm if the client trial format and client forms for the baby nutrition module will be the same as detailed here for foundational nutritional (with the 3-day food journal being for the baby instead)? I have a volunteer lined up and would like to send them an email with a brief overview so they know what will be required in a few weeks time. Thank you.</p>]]></message>

<message><![CDATA[<p>Hi Carley,</p><p>I would love to hear your thoughts on some alternatives to asian noodles (Udon noodles, egg noodles, etc).  What comes to mind for me are kelp noodles, sweet potato glass noodles, and buckwheat noodles.  Kelp noodles surely are the most nutrient dense option (more fiber, vitamins and minerals like iodine), however they're definitely the most expensive.  So considering a potential client's budget, I'd want to suggest sweet potato glass noodles, which are made from sweet potato starch instead of flour, but have little fiber + zero fat or protein.  I guess my question is how healthy is something like sweet potato starch?  A better alternative to wheat noodles, if you were to balance the meal wisely with fiber, lots of vegetables/greens, protein and healthy fats?</p>]]></message>

<message><![CDATA[<p>Angelina — firstly, thank you for your patience with my reply. I've been on set at a photoshoot for the past few days. Secondly, I'm so incredibly grateful that you've brought this oversight to light. You're absolutely correct that a conventional egg is better than no egg at all. I've changed this language to better reflect our intentions, and the quality guide is labelled as "Ideal, Better, Good, Base". I too greatly dislike the use of the word "avoid" when it comes to our food choices. In light of this, I did a word search and was surprised to find the word come up several times in this module. I'll be taking the necessary steps to emend this in the curriculum. Thanks again for bringing this up.</p>]]></message>

<message><![CDATA[<p>Hi Carley, someone reached out to me asking about the glucose tests. She failed the 1st test and mentioned she was very shocked by this as she eats healthy and exercises. I know there is a statistic that says there's a pretty substantial number of false positives. Just curious your take on this. I am hesitant to consult with her before the 3-hour test if there is nothing I can bring of value, assuming she is balancing her meals, eating nourishing foods and so forth. Thank you!</p>]]></message>

<message><![CDATA[<p>Hi Severine, thank you for your patience with my reply. I was on set at a photo shoot for a few days. Has this client expressed concerns over their baby's response  to high histamine foods, or have you suspected this?  A low-histamine diet could be helpful for those with eczema exhibiting symptoms that resemble histamine intolerance in which their eczema symptoms worsened after consuming histamine-rich foods. However, it isn't a standard protocol for everyone with eczema. In any case, to answer your question — yes, fermented foods are histamine-rich.</p>]]></message>

<message><![CDATA[<p>Hi Samantha, thank you for your patience with my reply. I was on set at a photo shoot for a few days. Yes, I absolutely feel that our graduates are well equipped to not only nutritionally support women with postnatal depletion, but perhaps even more importantly, are able to greatly reduce the risk of depletion occurring. I do feel as though this is what the postpartum course solely centralizes. The primary difference being Dr. Serallach dives deeper into topics such as sleep and relaxation practices (yoga, meditation), emotional wellbeing, and exercise, relationship with self and partner. While I practice these personally to some degree or another, they aren't my areas of expertise to educate on. However, I highly encourage you to explore them if they interest you. They're all clearly supportive of holistic health. And of course, always credit Dr. Serallach if citing or pulling inspiration from his work.</p>]]></message>

<message><![CDATA[<p>Hi Emma, these would be good options to suggest. As you identified, sweet potato starch may not be the most nutritionally diverse, but you could encourage this client to incorporate them as "part" of the meal and not *the* meal on their own. If vegetables were a suitable (agreeable) option, using a spiralizer is great for creating zucchini noodles or beet noodles. There's always spaghetti squash as well. Some people do well with sprouted grain noodles, although they can be higher cost than regular wheat noodles. However, there are more and more of these popping up and prices are going down. There's cassava noodles, whole grain rice noodles, or sprouted chickpea and/or lentil noodles too.</p>]]></message>

<message><![CDATA[<p>Animal based proteins / organ body clock</p><p>I don't know if it's the right place to ask this question, but I'll give it a try :) <br>I learned from previous nutrition training that with many foods, not only the combination of different food, but also the time of day when they are consumed, matters in order to absorb the nutrients in the best possible way. <br>For example, I have learned to minimize animal protein in the evening if possible, in order to relieve the liver. It would be more ideal to eat animal protein in the morning for breakfast, as this is when the stomach works best (to say it simple).<br>In my client trial I now have a client who eats cheese every evening, among other things. She writes, that she doesn't have a good sleep and would like to change that.</p><p>So my question: Do you see a connection here too, between eating animal based protein in the evening and a light sleep? Or do you think that it doesn't matter what time of the day you consume something? Thank you so much for your time!</p>]]></message>

<message><![CDATA[<p>Hi Carley, I've recently listened to a couple podcasts with Dr Steven Gundry who wrote the Plant Paradox (was recommended for me to read by a very health conscious friend), as well as other podcasts with Dr Paul Saladino (carnivore MD), who say (and I paraphrase) that lectin in specific fruit and veggies are toxic and the reason for xyz symptoms, therefore they are not meant to be consumed. He also debates white rice versus brown rice for example. I have not read Dr Gundry's book, but from what I have researched so far there does not seem to be a ton of scientific evidence to support this. However I am curious what is your take on this? Thanks!</p>]]></message>

<message><![CDATA[<p>I much prefer reserving all client resources to share during the consultation. It's easy for clients to misinterpret information without an explanation. They may be inclined to change the way they answer certain questions about their eating habits if they've already seen a list of our recommendations. Yes, it would be very helpful to share the meal plan with them.</p>]]></message>

<message><![CDATA[<p>Owph, big topic. In short, my answer is that mostly all foods contain potentially beneficial properties and potentially negative properties (lectin, phytase, salicylates, histamine, etc.) I believe that some foods may benefit or negatively impact one person more than another. But the bottom line is that this particular program focuses on pregnancy, postpartum, and babies — all stages where I wouldn't recommend introducing/imposing new dietary restrictions against fruit and veggies. Instead I favor a mindful approach to whole foods that are minimally processed.</p>]]></message>

<message><![CDATA[<p>Hmm, she may be referring to the fact that we generally consume WAY more omega 6 than omega 3. And the need to bring that closer to balance, which I agree with. However, fish oil contains omega 3 — so I'm confused myself. I do know that PUFAs are more susceptible to oxidization from heat/light/oxygen. So almonds are better in their raw/sprouted state rather than roasted (for example). We cover this (benefits/negatives) in much more depth in the module 2 lesson on fat.</p>]]></message>

<message><![CDATA[<p>There are many different approaches to nutrition philosophy, however, the timing as you've outlined isn't something that I personally subscribe to. Animal protein contains L-tryptophan, which is an amino acid that promotes sleep. It's also the precursor to melatonin. That said, there is no one size fits all and everyone has to find what works best for them. My primary concern would be when it comes to pregnancy specifically. Protein requirements are so high and I wouldn't want to risk inadequate intake by imposing restrictions around timing.</p>]]></message>

My sister in law has has some health issues (stemming from overwork, stress and bad diet) and has made a couple of lifestyle changes. She is very interested in making changes in regards to her diet but doesn't know where to start so she immediately popped into my head when thinking of a client. However I'm not sure if it's an issue or conflict of interest since she's my husbands sister. Thank you kindly for your time!</p>]]></message>

I wasn’t going to bring it up in my consultation with her since I don’t know much about it, but I was wondering for future reference if there are any dietary changes or supplements that help with this!

<message><![CDATA[<p>Hi Carley - my client has IBS in which she has been seeing an acupuncturist for for 5 years. She is 3 weeks PP and mentioned on her intake form that she "has not yet had a flare up but could happen in the future" - is there anything specific I should be recommending - aside from balancing meals, maintaining blood sugar and potentially eliminating inflammatory culprits such as dairy and gluten? I also read it could potentially be a zinc or B6 deficiency and that vitamin A could be necessary to keep the intestinal tract healthy. Could slippery elm be useful? She does take probiotics.</p><p>Also, she was diagnosed with hypothyroidism 4 ish years ago and takes medication daily. Should I be diving deeper into this postpartum? For example, encouraging her to have another full panel done? Not sure what is within my scope here but just want to make sure i am not skipping over something I should be touching on with her.<br>Thank you!!</p>]]></message>

<message><![CDATA[<p>Hi Sara, great to hear how considerate you're being with this client and her unique needs. Sometimes medication dosage for hypothyroidism needs to be adjusted postpartum. So I would suggest encouraging her to talk to her prescribing care provider about having a full panel.</p><p>As for IBS, this is considered a "pre-existing condition" and as such, it's not explored in this program. It's also not something you're expected to advise upon. There's actually a fine line with pre-existing condition. On one hand, it's useful when we have a basic understanding to help ensure the client receives the support they need. But on the other hand, we don't want to try to "educate ourselves on google" to try and support them ourselves. Not at all saying you were doing this, or had planned to! Just more that IBS is a complex issue that is best support by someone who specializes in it. Just as postpartum nutrition is complex and is best supported by someone who specializes in this field. So the best approach here to to provide advice with the disclaimer that she should decide and communicate if any of your recommendations are contraindicated with her IBS.</p><p>Thanks for checking in on this.</p>]]></message>

You're right that you won't have anything significant to share with this client on the topic quite yet. However, you can share that this is something you'll be learning about soon if she's like to meet with you again! Many of the recommendations are applicable outside of pregnancy as well. If you are interested in diving in more, I really love what Chris Kresser shares on the topic.</p>]]></message>

If I can recall it was frozen bananas, chlorophyll drops (nearly tasteless), pure mint extract, and cacao nibs (can sub for chocolate chips if you want). Thanks for notifying me of this. I'll be sure to update that tease of a dead link ;)</p>]]></message>

<message><![CDATA[<p>Hi there, my client is currently taking 2 supplements: breastfeeding vitamins and fish oil tablets. She was quite firm that her GP recommended these and she's not open to changing them / reviewing wholefoods to replace them. There were so many other opportunities to focus on in her intake form and food journal, so I feel I can better support by focusing on other opportunities. Is this acceptable, or should I talk more to quality of supplements / explain the benefits of foods in these areas? Thanks!</p>]]></message>

<message><![CDATA[<p>Swinging back to this discussion board to ask about Metanx. A client was prescribed this because she has MTHFR mutation and was told she needed methylated folate, but as far as she knows, no other reason. Through our discussion she realized there is glucose listed in the ingredients. The bottle costs her over $200 and not covered by insurance. Do you have any insight as to why they would prescribe this to her? It seems silly to spend this much money when she could choose a prenatal with methylated folate.<br>Thank you!</p>]]></message>

<message><![CDATA[<p>As far as I'm able to see, Metanx is 3 methylated/active B vitamins: B6, B9, B12, and riboflavin (B2 - but not active as far as I can tell). These could absolutely be sourced from a less expensive product. However, she would definitely have to check in with her prescribing care provider.</p><p>The full ingredient list is surprising with: Glucose, Syrup Solids, Mannitol, Milk, Soy, Flavors, Color. Just seems a little unnecessary.  But of course, there may be a medical reason these are included that I'm not familiar with.</p>]]></message>

<message><![CDATA[<p>Hello - My client was on a course of antibiotics in December, so fairly recently.  I believe in one of your videos you mentioned that after antibiotics we would recommend probiotics, in addition to fermented foods and that these should be taken for several weeks at a minimum.  Is this correct? If I'm making this recommendation do we have guidance somewhere on how to select a good quality probiotic? I don't recall seeing this in the supplement section, but let me know if I just missed it!  Thank you!</p>]]></message>

<message><![CDATA[<p>Hi Carley, I was wondering if you have any advice for fussy eaters? My client has a real issue with texture &amp; smell of foods and has been extremely limited in the variety of fruit / veg she consumes because of this (as well as other things like eggs, yoghurt etc). She wants to improve her diet &amp; try new things, but it is a real struggle. I have a lot of easy recommendations for how she can improve, but getting her to try is the issue - so any advice on this? Thanks!</p>]]></message>

<message><![CDATA[<p>Hi Carley! one more client related question regarding soaking grains.  In discussing soaking oats with my client, she mentioned that they slow cook their oats for 6-8 hours typically.  Does this also help break down the phytic acid? Would adding whey or lemon juice to the slow cooker be another way to achieve the same effect of soaking without having her change a meal prep process that already works for her and her family? Thanks!</p>]]></message>

<message><![CDATA[<p>Hi Sofia, we don't get into specific supplementation needs until the core courses, at which point we dive into this in great depth. So you aren't required to make recommendations until we reach that stage of the program. However it would be very helpful to provide the recommendations you gave above. You can simply say that "While I'm aren't entirely well-versed in supplementation yet, I do know that XYZ (as above)".</p>]]></message>

<message><![CDATA[<p>I think it would be appropriate to simply ask (during the consultation) if the meals were homemade or pre-made frozen/from a cafe. In the case of a client who consumes the bulk of their meals from pre-made frozen, it's not beneficial to suggest they start eating all made from scratch, as this may be too big of a transition and not sustainable. Rather, you can help them deduce what the best choices may be and even how to cook in bulk to batch *some* home cooked meals.</p>]]></message>

<message><![CDATA[<p>Hi Kelly, I have a ton of advice when it comes to toddlers! In terms of an adult, I would approach this in the same way that I would approach someone experiencing aversions during pregnancy. It will require that you have a lot of back &amp; forth and take great care in asking "does this resonate with you" and "does this seems like something you would include in your meals". Checking in after each recommendation will be key to see if they are something that she might actually try. Be prepared to suggest multiple ways to prepare these foods, as preparation style may be impactful. For example... no to scrambled eggs, but yes to a feta and potato quiche? No to a bowl of yogurt, but yes to adding yogurt in a smoothie or oatmeal?</p>]]></message>

<message><![CDATA[<p>All cooking does help to further break down phytic acid — whether the oats are pre-soaked or not. The acid medium is most impactful during the soaking rather than the cooking. You could suggest that they soak in the slow cooker prior to cooking. However, unless there are mineral deficiencies, or high nutritional requirements (pregnancy/postpartum), this step is a bonus not a requirement. I should clarify that it's never a "requirement" but it is especially beneficial in the outlines instances.</p>]]></message>

<message><![CDATA[<p>This is due to the processing that these grains go through to become flour. As a whole grain with the fiber intact, they digest slower — and as such, their sugars get released into the bloodstream more slowly. So those with blood sugar irregularities may be able to tolerate the whole grain better than their flour counterpart, where tthe fiber is "chopped smaller" and may spike blood sugar more. This would only be a potential consideration for those with the accompanying symptoms listed with whole grain flours.</p>]]></message>

<message><![CDATA[<p>Hi Carley! I’m far behind but trying to catch back up! I’m preparing for my client trial this week and am suddenly super nervous. Do you have any go-to open questions you like to get a first session going? I believe she’s doing her three days now but she’s sent back the intake form so I know that she says she eats almost vegan which then just made me more nervous because it’s so outside my normal wheelhouse! I want to be able to think of good swaps and recommendations but all of my normal ideas are quite omnivorous. Those whole protein food combos are never at the top of my head since I don’t use them. Do we have a section just on that I can go back to? I want to support her best I can but feel like I’m going to blank! Do we discuss the vitamins that are missing? I feel that’s too in depth for my current level.</p>]]></message>

<message><![CDATA[<p>Hi Carly,<br>Could you please clarify before I recommend any zinc supplements. The client is in her 1st trimester and still currently breastfeeding her older baby. She has been battling a virus for over a month now and would like to know if she can further supplement. Her prenatal vitamin contains 11mg/day and her zinc levels were done a month ago 11umol/L (10-25). She does eat meatx2 a day and a range of nuts and seeds but is also egg, dairy, gluten and grain free. From my reading the upper limit is 40mg. I am wondering if for a short period of time you could supplement with<br><a href="https://www.chemistwarehouse.com.au/buy/84091/ethical-nutrients-mega-zinc-40mg-60-tablets" rel="nofollow noopener" title="https://www.chemistwarehouse.com.au/buy/84091/ethical-nutrients-mega-zinc-40mg-60-tablets">https://www.chemistwarehous...</a> which has Zinc amino acid chelate (Meta Zn® - Zinc diglycinate) 200mg<br>Equiv. elemental Zinc 40mg but plus her multivitamin this would put her above the upper limit intake.</p>]]></message>

<message><![CDATA[<p>Hi Carley,</p><p>I have a client who suffers from UTI's quite often. Last year she had a miscarriage and was diagnosed with a severe UTI. The doctor didn't say this was the cause, however, she had no symptoms(UTI). Her mother also suffers from severe UTI's. She has recently become pregnant and extremely paranoid that this will occur again. I recommended a UTI home testing kit to help relieve her anxiety but why does this happen? How did she not have any symptoms? Have you come across this with any of your clients?</p><p>Thank you</p>]]></message>

<message><![CDATA[<p>1. Typically prenatal multivitamins are taken through the duration of breastfeeding. So a mother would discontinue after her baby has weaned. <br>2. It really depends on how well she was able to nourish herself during pregnancy, through postpartum, even how she was entering pregnancy. After breastfeeding, it would be great if she could continue on a DHA/omega and a vitamin D at minimum. Bt other than that it would has to be access individually — according to each persons needs/diet.</p>]]></message>

<message><![CDATA[<p>Hi Elise. For liability reasons, we're not able to advise that our clients supplement with a  daily dose above the tolerable upper intake level (UL) for any given nutrient. The only instance when this would be possible is if testing revealed that her zinc levels were below the healthy range, and a higher dose was recommended <i>by a prescribing practitioner</i> (MD/ND etc). Then we could support her in meeting those needs through food/supplements. However, it's not within our scope of practice to make these recommendations ourselves. Thank you for clarifying.</p>]]></message>

<message><![CDATA[<p>Hi Samantha, it is unusual that she did not have any symptoms. I can't say definitively why this happened. However, it may be possible that she normalizes early warning signs/symptoms as a sufferer of chronic UTIs. Due to the fact that he mother also suffers, it's likely that she's genetic predisposed.</p><p>I'm so sorry to learn of her loss. While a UTI alone is not linked to the cause of miscarriage, complications from a severe infection might. Such as if it ascends into the kidneys, causing a serious full-body infection. However, I would be very shocked if no symptoms were felt before it reach that stage. I would strongly recommend D-Mannose as a preventative measure for this client.</p><p><i>(Also a gentle reminder that we have to reserve the discussion board for active students rather than our alumni. I encourage you to post future client questions to our Facebook student community group.) </i></p>]]></message>

<message><![CDATA[<p>Hi Angelina — not to worry about falling behind. You're still on track :) <br>In the core courses (Pregnancy, Postpartum, and Babies), we'll get much more in depth about nutritional requirements and how to support vegan clients. This isn't something you're required to consult upon at this stage yet. It would be great if you could focus on quality and variety with this client. As a reminder, the Oh Baby Food Guide has a section that lists plant-based protein sources. And if you refer back to the Orientation, you'll also find a list of cues for "Asking Clients Supportive Questions". It's completely okay (and common) to feel nervous. But that's exactly why we have you practice with volunteer before jumping in with "real" paying clients. Wishing you the best of luck... I'm sure you'll do great!</p>]]></message>

<message><![CDATA[<p>Hi Carley,<br>For the client trials, one of my clients has been on antibiotics 3x/year regularly but doesn't supplement with a probiotic at all. She listed gut health and inflammation as a primary concern. Since I've completed the other modules, I am hoping to suggest a probiotic to support her gut, and also suggest foods that would be in line with the gut healing protocol. Would this be outside the scope, since it's foundational nutrition, or am I ok to go ahead, since I've already completed the rest of the modules?</p>]]></message>

<message><![CDATA[<p>Thank you! If they aren't taking any supplements should we suggest they be taking some if they are breastfeeding ? My client says she wouldn't mind finding a prenatal vitamin while she is feeding or is this too much out of my scope? Also she has said she wants to lose 5 Kilos. I know this isn't really within my scope to make any promises or suggestions towards this but am assuming that I explain that it isn't an are I am well versed in and that our focus will be on creating a balance, nutrient dense diet to optimise overall health and wellness and that weight loss could be a positive symptom as a result of this but not promised? Does that make sense ?</p>]]></message>

<message><![CDATA[<p>Hi Hanna, I actually just moved a Q&amp;A video about supporting pre-existing conditions from Pregnancy to this course. It can now be found at the end of module 2. This will apply to her high cholesterol and desired health goals. Please note that some of her desired health goals will be discussed throughout the core courses but you aren't expected to advise on them as of yet.</p><p><i>For what it's worth, I really like Chris Kresser's approach to high cholesterol, however, this would just be purely informative. I wouldn't want you to or expect you to relay this information back to this (or any) client during a consult. </i></p><p>In regards to her food journal, this is likely enough to go on without requesting additional info. The oats are likely instant as they're "in a sachet" but I would ask about this when you meet with her. With the other items such as protein powder and spaghetti, you can ask during the consult and have your recommendations flexible depending on her answers. Of course, feel free to reach out if you'd feel better prepared entering her consult with any additional information.</p>]]></message>

<message><![CDATA[<p>Aw I feel for this poor mama! HG is covered in our Pregnancy course and when it comes to postpartum, the most supportive approach is to help the mother create effective strategies for nourishing herself with nutrient dense foods. As you know, during the postpartum period it's partly education as to "what" but also support as to "how". How can she reliably have foods on hand that are not elaborate to make... easy nutrient dense swaps, freezer meals, one-handed snacks, etc.</p><p>As for nutrients, the primary focus would be on the postpartum requirements as outlined in module 2. These are absolutely the highest priority for any new mother but especially those who weren't able to nourish themselves as mindfully during pregnancy. Of course we want to replenish the mother but it's also important to consider any nutrients that can enrich her breastmilk as well (if breastfeeding), such as DHA &amp; vitamin D.</p>]]></message>

<message><![CDATA[<p>Hi Hanna — In regards to leafy green &amp; non-starchy vegetables, it's primarily that they are quite nutrient dense and provide a rich array <b>micro</b>nutrients (vitamins, minerals, enzymes, antioxidants). Normally I would never promote a foods for it's qualities of being "low calorie" as calories are very important and our singular goals shouldn't be to strive to reduce them. However, when it comes to dark leafy greens, they are a great way to add nutrient value to an already calorie rich meal with balanced <b>macro</b>nutrients (fat, protein, carbohydrates). So essentially they're a great way to "boost" meals and nutritional value.</p><p>As for fermented foods, they are rich in probiotics to support gut health. If this is new to you, there is a very small 101 on the microbiome in module 2. Then we get into much deeper depth about the importance of probiotics/fermented foods/gut health in the core courses.</p>]]></message>

<message><![CDATA[<p>Another question from me. My other client for the client trials seems like she's going through some pre-menopausal symptoms even though she is only 39, as well as chronic bacterial vaginosis. She does list them as part of her primary concerns but they seem out of my scope of practice to support. I was hoping to address her concerns by suggesting a gut support protocol to help strengthen her immune system, but I'm completely unsure about supporting pre-menopausal symptoms such as night sweats. In this case, should I just support her in making healthier, more balanced and higher quality choices?</p>]]></message>

However, I wouldn't recommend that you advise on this until after you've completed the postpartum course and gain a fuller understanding of the nutritional requirements of a breastfeeding mother.

<message><![CDATA[<p>Hi Soukaina,</p><p>Yes this can be a little trickier.   I would definitely recommend that formula intake remain the same for quite some time as babies typically only consume a small amount of solids at the beginning.</p><p>Formula can be offered first, then aim to offer solids at the middle point before their next bottle. So if bottles were offered every three hours, solids would be 1.5 hours after a bottle.</p><p>A reduction in bottles likely won’t happen until about 10 months. Some babies who begin consuming more solids may naturally decrease their formula (by not consuming the entire bottle after solids) and that’s okay.  As for the reduction, some parents prefer dropping bottles by spreading the time out between each formula feed. However, some prefer to just skip a single bottle and mid-day is commonly the first to go.</p><p>I still feel a flexible, less prescriptive, somewhat baby-led approach is still most useful with this transition. However, it’s important *not* to reduce bottles for several months, and then *only* when baby is reliably consuming a variety of solids 3x a day. And of course, never to stop formula all together until 12 months minimum.</p>]]></message>

<message><![CDATA[<p>I do believe that pasture raised, grass fed is preferable. Due to the fact that cow's aren't meant to consume such large quantities of grain, which can impact their health. As for slaughter, this would absolutely be an ethical consideration. The Humane Slaughter Act is in place throughout Canada and the US, however, to my understanding this isn't well enforced. I advise continuing to do the work you are by asking questions to local butchers to get a better understanding of their practices. Even if you don't get the answers you were hoping for, the more people who inquire, the more likely that positive changes will be made.</p>]]></message>

My husband loves to make oats in the morning, but finds soaked oats to be a lot mushier in texture than what he is used to so prefers them unsoaked. Is this just a matter of taste or is there a way to make them less mushy? I also recently tried soaking steel cut oats and they came out very mushy/almost gelatinous.  I soaked overnight and then rinsed them before adding fresh water and cooking. Any tips? Thanks!</p>]]></message>

Lately I’ve been seeing some friends making their own eggshell supplements by boiling, baking and blending up eggshells from their own hens. I’ve also thought about eating some of the soft bones that I have leftover from making bone broth (and my two year old always eats the ends off of chicken wing bones, so I feel like she has something going on intuitively there!). I know it’s impossible to know how much calcium these contain so it would be hard to recommend to a client, but I’ve been considering it for personal use since I’ve been breastfeeding for over two years and haven’t been supplementing with calcium.</p>]]></message>

You can say that you didn't find it difficult, then explain that this is the way you usually eat.

<message><![CDATA[<p>Admittedly, it is a bit of a trial and error. Generally speaking, if you usually put 1 cup of water in to cook your oats (as an example) you would put less as the oats have already soaked up some water. After doing it a few times you do get a feel for it. That said, if someone truly enjoys oats but doesn't like them soaked, I really wouldn't worry about it too much. Yes, the nutrients in soaked oats are more bioavailable, but unsoaked oats certainly aren't "unhealthy"! In times of high nutrient demands, such as pregnancy/postpartum, "every little bit helps".  However, your husband should be just fine.</p><p>If any seasoned soakers reading this have any tips... please share :)</p>]]></message>

<message><![CDATA[<p>Soaked nuts should keep 5-7 days. Whereas soaked/dehydrated should keep in the pantry for several weeks+. Babies don't typically eat too many nuts, even ground or in cooking. So the salt preparation should be fine. If you were going to soak nuts to make almond flour and bake something for baby, then omitting the salt may be best.</p>]]></message>

<message><![CDATA[<p>Hi Emily, great question. Yes there are link to ABX and allergies. I'd say that it depends on how old the baby is and how long the mother is taking the ABX for. If the baby is younger and the round is shorter, then there is time to boost gut health and intro high-risk allergenic foods after. However, if the baby is older and still has many allergens to go before their 1st birthday, then I would prioritize the allergenic foods. Another consideration is if baby is categorized as high-risk. Also if they have any symptoms of compromised gut health either before/during/after the ABX.</p>]]></message>

<message><![CDATA[<p>The list in module 4 are indisputably highly inflammatory foods. Dairy is less clear cut as it's easy to find studies for both sides. This is an interesting systematic review of the clinical evidence from 78 studies... <a href="https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/10408398.2014.967385" rel="nofollow noopener" title="https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/10408398.2014.967385">https://www.tandfonline.com...</a> It found that dairy appears to have an anti-inflammatory effect. It also showed that fermented dairy had the most beneficial anti-inflammatory properties. And unsurprisingly, dairy was inflammatory for those with a milk allergy — do to the inflammatory response of an allergy. Overall, if consuming dairy I recommend to prioritize quality whenever possible, and  reduce/avoid if symptomatic.</p>]]></message>

<message><![CDATA[<p>Hey Carley! I was reading this section in the multivitamin handout "As discussed in Pregnancy Nutrition, one-a-day and 'gummy’ prenatal multivitamins are not su"cient." and I'd love to know if we can have access to this info here in postpartum! I have been looking for ages fo the efficacy of gummy vitamins so i'd love to see what you have on it, thank you!</p>]]></message>

<message><![CDATA[<p>Yes, for sure. Basically, if client has a hard time with all ofter forms, gummies are still better than not taking a prenatal multi at all. It's advised to source high quality as much as possible.</p><p>This is the list of various types with pros/cons:</p><p><b>Capsules or tablets:</b> Recommended for all. <br>‣Pros: Easily available, as they are the most common form of multivitamins. Convenient to take.  <br>‣Cons: The dose frequently requires up to 6 caps/tabs be taken per day, which may be challenging for some clients. Not the most effective delivery method for fat-soluble nutrients, such as vitamin D3, as they require a source of fat to be absorbed properly.</p><p><b>Powder:</b> Recommended for some.  <br>‣Pros: May be more tolerable for those who have difficulty swallowing capsules or those who feel nauseous after taking their prenatal multivitamins.  <br>‣Cons: Less convenient.</p><p><b>Gummy:</b> Rarely recommended. (Only when high-quality and it truly is the best option for your client’s unique needs.) <br>‣Pros: May taste more appealing, and therefore increase likelihood of regular consumption. <br>‣Cons: Often contain added sugar, artificial colors, flavors, and additives.</p><p><b>“One-a-day”:</b> Not recommended. <br>‣Pros: Convenient. <br>‣Cons:  •Manufacturers don’t add sufficient levels of essential nutrients and leave certain bulkier nutrients out entirely. Daily nutrients required to maintain optimal levels do not fit into just one pill. •“One-a-day” pills are often pressed and packed more firmly, making them harder to digest and assimilate (utilize).•Poor-quality, synthetic nutrients are almost always chosen for their cost.  •Many brands contain unnecessary and potentially harmful ingredients, such the numerous different artificial dyes in this “#1 OB/GYN recommended prenatal vitamin”.</p>]]></message>

<message><![CDATA[<p>Hi Jaimi, we recommend referencing the list of food sources at the end of each nutrient lesson for ideas. If there are no matches, we ask if you would recommend supplementation for that particular baby. As for foods to delay/limit, we recommend reviewing that section to ensure your suggestions don't conflict with those listed. Hope that helps!</p>]]></message>

<message><![CDATA[<p>I’ve been struggling with this since the pregnancy course and was wondering if you could weigh in. As mothers, we are regularly told that there is such a wide range of development that is considered “normal.” For instance, a baby walking at 10 months versus 18 months. However, in this course we are shown that studies have connected nutritional deficiencies with delayed neurological development, motor skills, language skills, etc. We live in a world where making a claim about this correlation could cause someone to say we are intolerant, insensitive or something along those lines, when in reality, I think we all want our children to be as healthy, smart and strong as possible. Most mothers are just uninformed and are told that their diet doesn’t affect anything really. How can we address this in an empowering, educational way without hurting feelings?</p><p>I know this is kind of a loaded question, but I just wanted to put it out there. Now that I know all of this information I’m making connections between my friends’ diets and their children - in a completely non-judgmental but curious way! And I definitely don’t share the information with them because I don’t believe in guilting mothers, but I do believe in know better, do better, to the best of your abilities.</p>]]></message>

<message><![CDATA[<p>Oh Theresa..... yup that's loaded! And complex.</p><p>I find this is a HUGE point of contention when it comes to how maternal diet can influence breast milk quality. The fact is, certain nutrients in breast milk are influenced by diet but you don't want to cause stress or shame anyone. In my experience this conversation gets people very fired up.</p><p>I also believe it's important to remember that diet is one important pillar of health, alongside many others. There's stress, sleep, sunshine, environmental, and on and on. While this course is about nutrition, I find that presenting it holistically helps clients frame it in a less dogmatic way.</p><p>Overall, I think about the mothers who feel "If only I had known". While someone might feel devastated thinking that something they did or didn't do could have contributed to XYZ, you'll usually be working with women at a time when they can implement changes to give their children the best start possible (for the factors that are in our control). That said, generational health is very real too and our genetics are created by way of our ancestors and their health.</p><p>Just remain as supportive and considerate as you possibly can. I can tell by the way you brought this up that your approach would be supportive and considerate anyways.</p>]]></message>

<message><![CDATA[<p>This is the response I was hoping for. I wish more people would talk about generational health. I often think about how my diet and lifestyle (the parts I can control) will affect my future grandchildren and their children. Presenting it in a holistic way will definitely be the best route.

<message><![CDATA[<p>Great question! As allergies occur from the protein of a food, it's actually very, very rare for an allergic reaction to happen from fish oil. Typically, I would recommend that it's safe to start with fish oil before doing a proper "intro" to fish. The exception would be for a babe who is high risk and certainly one who has a family history of fish allergies.</p>]]></message>

<message><![CDATA[<p>It can really make your head spin (at least mine feels like it's spinning). For instance my 6 year old son has his adult teeth coming in and they're extremely crowded. If you're familiar with Weston A. Price's work, then you'll know what his findings are on jaw formation and teeth spacing. However, teeth spacing in particular are something that gets passed down from several generations. My son can't eat his way out of crowding with a good diet. Although diet can definitely help support teeth health in general.</p><p>On the flip side, my mother has an autoimmune disorder, and I know that how we eat and live can definitely impact the likelihood of this revealing itself in myself or my children.</p><p>It's such a mix of the precautions you can take for yourself and your children, and what's been passed down to you from generations past.</p>]]></message>

<message><![CDATA[<p>A second question...<br>I understand that DHA is a crucial nutrient for the development of baby’s brain, my question is because we are not to introduce any fish until 8+ months as it is a common allergen, is it advised to NOT supplement baby with DHA during the period that they have started solids at 6 months to the time we can begin introducing fish at 8 months?  This question came up last week for me, but I figured it made more sense asking here. Can babies have cod liver oil at 6 months?  Would they show a reaction to this or not as it is mostly concentrated in the fat opposed to protein?</p><p>I am due in May and definitely plan to continue supplementing cod liver oil while breastfeeding, wondering how soon I can offer this to my little one!</p>]]></message>

<message><![CDATA[<p>I suppose a follow up question ( to confirm what I learned in last weeks module about Maternal Status, breastfeeding and supplementation) would be, since I plan to supplement Cod Liver Oil as I breastfeed, there would be no reason to supplement baby on this before the 8 month mark that I plan to introduce fish, correct?</p><p>How much Cod Liver Oil is sufficient to ensure that both myself, and my baby get through breastmilk?  I feel a strong pull to enroll in the PostPartum Course one day, is this covered there?</p><p>Sorry for all the questions, as a first time mum I am sooo intrigued by the deep connection we share with our babes in utero and after and how much the decisions we make have the ability to support them to truly thrive!</p>]]></message>

<message><![CDATA[<p>Hi Carley,</p><p>I would like to ask about your advice - when a 4,5 month old breastfed baby is not gaining weight (no conditions diagnosed, just occasional reflux) and is recommended to start solids by his paediatrician to get extra calories. It would make sense, but what if the baby is not showing any signs of readiness just yet? What would you recommend to do in this case? Can mum do something about her breastmilk to make it more caloric..?</p><p>Thanks! :-)<br>Lucie</p>]]></message>

<message><![CDATA[<p>I do mention Co10 briefly in one of the additional videos at the end of this module, called "Fertility Supplements". Basically, it's a very common supplement for fertility and many women can become quite dependent on it, especially if it's helped them to successfully achieve pregnancy. While CoQ10 "hasn't been studied during pregnancy" it's generally considered safe. However, there are so many other supplements that are more beneficial to focus on during pregnancy, I really recommend discontinuing CoQ10 to avoid supplement overwhelm.</p>]]></message>

<message><![CDATA[<p>Ah thank you for bringing this to my attention. It's meant to just be "low-risk foods". I've amended it to reflect this. What's meant by that is I don't recommend an allergenic food to be the very first food that baby is introduced to when starting solids. So, for example, they could try sweet potato, banana, or avocado, etc. After they've successfully had several introductions of low-risk foods, you can begin testing high-risk allergenic foods.</p>]]></message>

<message><![CDATA[<p>No need to apologize about questions... that's what this space is for!</p><p>Yes, absolutely this is covered in great length throughout the Postpartum Nutrition course. General recommendations for postpartum are 1,300 mg/day (1.3 g) fish oil, with 350 mg/day of DHA (minimum of 200 mg). Nature/biology always favors baby first when it comes to omega 3s, so maternal stores will become depleted to ensure that baby gets what they need. If a mother is well nourished and supplementing herself, that should be enough for baby as well. Of course, there are many considerations covered in the course that are difficult to properly sum up here.</p>]]></message>

<message><![CDATA[<p>Hi Lucie, It's hard to say without knowing the baby's specifics. Generally speaking, it's still advised to wait until a baby meets the signs of readiness. I'd recommend the mother to consult with an IBCLC to ensure that milk supply and latch are sufficient. I don't want to advise against a doctor's recommendations but I do have to say that many are hyper concerned about chart and numbers, when many healthy babies fall on either end of "healthy".</p>]]></message>

I couldn't find anything on the market that I would like either, so I am very grateful for your book as I am aligned with your philosophy and view on nutrition. Is there any chance to get pdf version of the book before the hardcover gets delivered (to Europe)?</p>]]></message>

<message><![CDATA[<p>Hi Carley! Yes, indeed! Many doctors are like that from my experience too. The baby is otherwise healthy, meeting all the milestones, so I it's probably good to wait as you say before introducing solids and keep breastfeeding as much as possible. (So, the mum's diet does not effect her milk and its caloric content?) The baby is not losing weight, just not gaining. The lactation consultant might be a solution. Thank you! :-)</p>]]></message>

<message><![CDATA[<p>Could I please get some clarification on the GBS section: "If a mother is not treated with antibiotics during labor, the chance her baby will develop symptoms due to GBS is 0.5%" and then "If a GBS+ mother does not receive antibiotics during labor, the baby’s risk of risk of a serious, life-threatening GBS infection is 1-2%, The death rate from from a GBS infection is 2-3% for full-term infants, but 20-30% for infants born earlier than 33 weeks. Im confused how all of these relate: is the first saying that a mother without GBS still has a .5% chance of giving it to her child? Or is it saying .5% of positive mother's will pass it on and then of that .5%, 1-2% will be serious, and then of the 1.2% 2-3% may die? I'm very confused.</p>]]></message>

<message><![CDATA[<p>Interestingly, those who would benefit from probiotic foods and supplements *the very most* often have unpleasant side effects initially from consuming them. <br> The best way to describe this is that their microbiome is so out of balance with "bad guys", that when the "good guys" are introduced, there's a battle that leads to bloating, gas, stomach upset, and/or loose stools. Unfortunately, the only way through is to press on. It's best to start with a very low dose and build up from there. Tell her to expect these symptoms but that they will subside eventually, and that her digestion will be much better and stronger for it. As an alternate, she could source a probiotic that doesn't include lactobacillus until her microbiome is stronger. However, my guess is that it's not necessarily the lactobacillus that she's sensitive too, but rather what I've described here. She's likely tried a few different probiotic brands, all with lactobacillus as they're so common, and that she's had a reaction to all of them, then deduced that she's sensitive to all of these strains.</p>]]></message>

<message><![CDATA[<p>Dear Carley,</p><p>So I have few question regarding this module :</p><p>1. I've read so much about introducing mushrooms, usually the recommendations are that it is best to wait first birthday or even longer and then introduce them slowly and carefully, so I was little bit surprised to see them on the list. They can be introduced before? I assume that the it is important they are fresh?<br>2. Similar question is regarding wild game meat? In all the books that I read the recommendation is to wait until at least first year or even 18 months as they can be contaminated. Does it makes any difference to introduce meat from some animal caught in the forest or some that was living on a farm?</p><p>3. What about bacteria that can be found in the raw, cold pressed juices made from vegetables? We don't have to worry considering the fact it is only recommended in small amounts or?<br>4. Do we have to worry that the seeds of some fruits can be harmful to little babies? I assume that there is no worries if the baby is eating variety of fruits?<br>5. I am also curious why the organ meats are not mention in 'Baby-friendly foods'? I assume they are also great source of proteins and other important nutrients?</p><p>Many thanks in advance,<br>Ana</p>]]></message>

<message><![CDATA[<p>Hi Ana,</p><p>1. MUSHROOMS: This must be a cultural/geographical difference as delaying the introduction of mushrooms is not practiced in North America. I tried looking into it to see what the reservation is regards to in Croatia, but I haven't been able to come across anything. Can you share what the concern might be in your country? Maybe you hav access to different mushroom then we do n North America? While there have been a few cases of mushrooms carrying pathogenic bacteria it's quite rare and other produce is certainly higher risk, yet these foods are still not recommended to delay – for the most part. When offering to babies, it's recommended to serve cultivated mushrooms that have been cooked.</p><p>2. GAME MEAT: Again, this may differ according to where you live. Generally speaking, I usually regard wild game meat North America as more healthy as the eat their natural diet, live in their natural habitat, aren't exposed to hormones/antibiotics, etc. Of course, it should be from a trusted hunter who is capable of identifying if the animal is healthy and safe to consume. And from those who do not use lead bullet (they are banned according to my knowledge, but may still be in use). I know of local hunters who get deer and grouse, both of which are perfectly safe for babes to consume.</p><p>3. RAW JUICE: This is in the Pregnancy Nutrition course. As you're not joining us for that course, I'll email you the information. It's too much to share here.</p><p>4. SEEDS: It's recommended to remove any notable seeds, such as orange, melon, or squash seeds. But it's not concerning if one (or a few) of these are eaten. Of course, larger pits such as those from apricots are to be removed. However, smaller edible seeds, such as those from cucumbers are not a concern at all. Was there a specific seed you were curious about?</p><p>5. They should be! Liver is mentioned in the course elsewhere, but organ meats should be in that 'Baby-friendly Foods' list specifically. I'll add them, thank you.</p>]]></message>

<message><![CDATA[<p>Thanks for this great question, and for your patience with my reply. The truth is that the science around the microbiome is very, very new.</p><p>A great example of this is the sterility of the womb. It was believed to be sterile for over a century. Then researchers began finding bits of evidence against sterility more than three decades ago. However it was accepted as a scientific fact until 2014!</p><p>Another example that highlights the most drastic scientific oversight in regards to the microbiome is that probiotics aren't prescribed alongside antibiotics. With all we're learning about the importance of beneficial bacteria, it's shocking to me that it's not common practice to prescribe them to be taken following a round of antibiotics.</p><p>For decades the scientific community regarded the term leaky gut as "pseudoscience quackery". The mere mention of it would certainly leave you primed for an eye roll from almost all doctors or pediatricians. Luckily now, this condition is slowly starting to get the desperate recognition it deserves. Studies like this linking dysbiosis and gut permeability with a wide array of chronic inflammatory diseases <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6996528/" rel="nofollow noopener" title="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6996528/">https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.go...</a>.</p><p>To add to the confusion, the scientific community doesn't have a specific parameters for identifying food sensitivities. Therefore, it's not as highly recognized or supported as true allergies, which are obviously much easier to diagnose (reaction within a few hours) and treat (avoidance).</p><p>There are more studies popping up showing the evidence of gut health and eczema (eg. <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6048199/)" rel="nofollow noopener" title="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6048199/)">https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.go...</a>. However, I'm sure we're still a long way out from having this not only recognized, but also supported by pediatricians.</p>]]></message>

<message><![CDATA[<p>Screening for anemia is standard practice during pregnancy and the woman's care provider will identify if she has anemia, what type it is, and the severity. Interestingly, the dose of iron required to resolve iron-deficiency anemia is significantly higher than the maximum dose sold over the counter. As such, the doctor will prescribe a high-dose iron and the role of a Certified Nutrition Consultant will be to help support through nutrition and potential side effects (constipation, etc.). As for folate and B12, the protocol will always come from the prescribing practitioner and our role will be a supportive one. I'll adjust that in the curriculum as you're correct, there is no indeed no protocol to refer back to. However, with these in particular we can encourage our client to talk to their practitioner about methylated Bs (folate/B12), which is even more important for those with anemia related deficiencies.</p>]]></message>

<message><![CDATA[<p>Hi Janine, I can see why you were confused. It seems that the "0.5% stat" and the "1-2% stat" were referring to the same rate of risk, but from 2 different sources who referenced different percentages.</p><p>The correct information is...</p><p>For mothers who test positive for GBS but are not treated with antibiotics, there is a <s>0.5%</s> 1-2% (according to the CDC) likelihood that her baby will develop symptoms of GBS. (This is 0.2% when treated with ABX.) The fatality rate from those 1-2% + 0.2% of babies who contract GBS is then 2-3% for full-term infants, but approximately 20% and as high as 30% for infants born earlier than 33 weeks.</p><p>I had several different researchers working with me to create the curriculum. I would sometimes replace certain sources and studies when more reputable ones were found. That seems to be the case here, however, when the new source was found, I forgot to remove the initial source referencing the 0.5% risk. I’ll amend this now, thank you for bringing it to my attention!</p>]]></message>

<message><![CDATA[<p>Hi Carley,</p><p>I am trying to get my head around the Gut Support Protocol and just wanted to clarify my understanding with you please. Apologies as the answer may be obvious, but this is all new ground being covered for me.</p><p>With regards to the elimination diet, the flowchart (I appreciate this is a simplification but I found it very useful) seems to imply that after eliminating the suspected trigger food(s) for 3-4 weeks, there is a reintroduction, regardless of whether the symptoms have cleared up? I was wondering what happens if the food that has been eliminated does not bring about any improvements in symptoms? Would you not just add that food back into the diet and expect not to see any changes, then move onto elimination again for a different food? If you were to follow the flow chart and monitor the reintroduction of the food and find that a 'reaction' occurs (or more rather a continuation of symptoms in this case) it might wrongly imply that this food is the cause, when in reality it's likely to be a food that has not been eliminated yet?</p><p>For example: eliminating dairy from baby's diet when baby has symptoms of gas and bloating. After 4 weeks, the symptoms have shown no improvement. Therefore, I would've thought that the next step would be to try eliminating another food for 4 weeks (instead of reintroducing and monitoring the symptoms when dairy is given again).</p><p>The complication here I suppose is if the food that has been eliminated is only one of two or more trigger foods affecting the baby. In this scenario, we would expect that symptoms improve even if not fully clear up?</p><p>I have included a diagram to try to articulate what I mean here.</p><p>Thank you as always <a href="https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/504eaf9399fe5101d029f8c642d0a1f7b77697f28ffed96fb27b7187b8f221d3.jpg" rel="nofollow noopener" title="https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/504eaf9399fe5101d029f8c642d0a1f7b77697f28ffed96fb27b7187b8f221d3.jpg">https://uploads.disquscdn.c...</a></p>]]></message>

<message><![CDATA[<p>This was answered on the discussion board in module 2 as well to correspond with the quality guide. I'm happy to post the reply here as well!</p><p>"This can actually get really tricky. I just updated this section in the curriculum to try and provide more clarity. The fish that are partially farm raised, then released into the wild and caught are called "stocked" fish. Sometimes referred to as wild-caught, but the distinction between wild and wld-caught is NOT strictly adhered to. In truth, stocked fish are also always labelled as "wild" as well. So we wouldn't be able to differentiate as consumers. The only chance we'd have is to buy directly from the fishermen or a sustainably minded fishmonger who knows their product well. That said, looking for the label wild (or wild-caught) is our best bet."</p>]]></message>

<message><![CDATA[<p>Unfortunately, it's quite difficult to do in this way. It's much more effective when the baby/child is consuming foods themselves. However, some mothers do find some measurable relief for their little ones when eliminating dairy, specifically. We should encourage maternal intake of probiotics for beneficial bacteria and fish oil for its anti-inflammatory properties, as both are transfered via breast milk.</p>]]></message>

<message><![CDATA[<p>Hi Lozzie,</p><p>An excess of thyroid hormone (hyperthyroid) is shown cause a rise in body temperature. While a deficiency in thyroid hormone (hypothyroid)  is shown to lower body temperature. However, it's best that a client work with a naturopath or functional medicine doctor to gain the markers for tracking this. In general, conventional doctors don't support this as a tool for diagnosis. While basal temperature tracking can give a good indication of thyroid health, is not definitive in an of itself.</p>]]></message>

<message><![CDATA[<p>Hello :)</p><p>I have a question regarding steps to take for the elimination diet for Eczema.  Say someone suspects their trigger food for eczema patches is dairy, as they have eliminated dairy for 3-4 weeks and have noticed incredible improvement in the patches.  According to the elimination diet + healing protocol, we are instructed to have them reintroduce dairy again (after those 3-4 weeks) while also implementing the gut healing protocol, and then monitoring the skin closely for any flare ups.</p><p>I am very new to this as I havent yet had experience introducing solids/potential allergens to my own, but from your experience with your own son and your clients, when it comes to the reintroduction phase, how often should that same trigger food be reintroduced? Daily? Every few days? Weekly?  Are flare ups typically immediate for eczema?  This may have been outlined in the PDF's, but I did find myself needing clarification when working on assignment 2.</p><p>Thanks so much!</p>]]></message>

<message><![CDATA[<p>It's usually a relatively reliable indication. However, as you identified, it's not always the case 100% of the time — such as with folate. Some key words you can look for would be: acetate, bitartrate, chloride, gluconate, hydrochloride, nitrate, and succinate.</p>]]></message>

<message><![CDATA[<p>Hi Rachel, great question and you inspired me to work towards adding this into the curriculum. While it is entirely possible to continue breastfeeding while pregnant, and then tandem nurse after baby is born — we can support the mother to ensure her nutritional reserves do not become depleted.</p><p>We're not able to determine precise "daily dosage" recommendations for certain nutrients, as each woman's needs vary according to how much milk she is producing (how old is her toddler/how often are they nursing, etc.). That said, the nutrients to focus on are very much the same as outlined in the pregnancy and postpartum courses, respectively. Therefore we would just encourage the mother to simply eat enough to satisfy her increased hunger, even if it feels as though they are eating "a lot". Increasing calories (by following hunger cues, not counting calories) through nutrient-dense foods is recommended to support the pregnancy and continued lactation.</p><p>Some examples of special considerations that should be made (via increased mindfulness and nutritional support) are women who:<br>- are anemic<br>- don't eat dairy or fish,<br>- are vegan<br>- are unable to consume enough calories (morning sickness/HG)</p><p>However, this is also the case for any woman during pregnancy/lactation.</p>]]></message>

While the symptoms are not immediate (that would indicate an allergy) they are more delayed over a few days. That said, if the gut has been supported and the child is "less reactive", they may not show symptoms immediately (after the first 2 introductions) but rather worsen after the food (dairy in this case) has been "added back into the child’s diet, as desired." You would encourage the parent to continue monitoring and remove the food again for 3-4 weeks while continuing to work in the protocol, then retest again.</p>]]></message>

<message><![CDATA[<p>Hello, I have a couple of follow up questions that I'd like to report back to my trial client about as I said I'd ask. My client is plant-based so many of her meals contained soy products and she used soy milk. During our discussion I recommended finding alternatives to soy products explaining that they contain phytoestrogens that can mess with hormone balance, particularly since she listed she had hypothyroidism. Her response was "oh I thought all that stuff wasn't true" as I'm sure this is an issue that has been in and out of the news she said that a friend or someone told her it wasn't true. So anyway what is the research that we are using at Oh Baby for this recommendation? Is it something I can pass along to her that she can review?<br>Secondly, I was wondering is there a nice client handout for supplement quality? Since she is plant based and has to rely on supplements for her nutrients I wanted to go over quality but it was a little challenging saying all the things and not being able to give her something to review on her own. Is there an overview we can use as a handout? Thanks!</p>]]></message>

<message><![CDATA[<p>Hi Sofia, I'm actually not involved in the printing, shipping, or distribution whatsoever. I just lent my expertise to the project. I was actually surprised by the shipping costs myself as well. However, Luka ships direct from her home in Australia and explains more about the associated shipping costs on her ‘milk to meals’ pinned story highlight on IG. As the book is self-published, costs are high on many levels. It's not being mass produced, it's not drop shipped, and it's printed in Australia (rather than Asia). Luka shares more on the transparency of the costs here <a href="https://milktomeals.com/pages/transparency" rel="nofollow noopener" title="https://milktomeals.com/pages/transparency">https://milktomeals.com/pag...</a>. The only way the cost may change is if the book gets picked up by a publisher at some point (who can produce larger quantities and drop-ship).</p>]]></message>

<message><![CDATA[<p>Dear Carley,<br>My biggest apologies for my late replay...</p><p>Here in Croatia we have so many opposite recommendations and lots of them are quite conservative. Moms have so many questions and are so cautious and scared when starting solids. Recently I purchased a new book about baby and children nutrition written by our most famous pediatric gastroenterologist and dietitian and the recommendations are quite different from the ones I learned hear so I am so happy to hear your opinion on some of these topics, thank you so much for this, it helps a lot...</p><p>1. It is recommend to wait with mushrooms because they can easy be carrying pathogenic bacteria (this is listed as reason no.1), they are hard to digest and are highly perishable. The most commonly used mushrooms here are button mushrooms, oyster mushrooms and porcini mushrooms. The recommendations for shiitake and truffles are to wait until the child is three years old. I don't know which kind of mushrooms do you consume the most and which are suitable?<br>Also, can we recommend mushrooms as a valuable source of vitamin D?</p><p>2. I understand this approach and it makes perfect sense to me. However, I talked to one local hunter and he told me they still use lead bullets here in Croatia, so I don't know if it would be best to avoid these kind of meat?</p><p>4. I get a lot of question about seeds so I wanted to ask this event that for me personally, they don't present any harm is baby is eating variety of fruits and the seeds are being removed at most occasions. Thank you for your rationale! I know that apples seeds can be toxic because of cyanide they contain, so I assume that kind of chemical compounds present some concern in mothers.</p><p>I also wanted to ask few more questions :).</p><p>1. Would you say that nutritional yeast is suitable for babies diet?</p><p>2. I understand that it would be best that the food (especially purees) are not reheated for babies because of some harm compounds that can be developed during that process (especially spinach and carrot), right? However, how long can the cooked food stand at room temperature and still be considered as safe for baby to eat?</p><p>3. I often get question about supplements that would enhance a baby immunity. In addition to high quality and nutritious diet, I usually recommend probiotics, DHA, vitamin D... Here in Croatia beta-glucan is quite popular, however I don't know what to think about it. What would you say and do you maybe have some else to add?</p><p>4. If I understand correctly, when feeding kids with purees, it is best to start with one ingredient puree for baby to get to know the taste and then slowly start to mix different food and strive to have key ingredient of healthy puree?</p><p>5. I know that often the mother who bottle fed their baby are concerned they are thirsty and usually they are recommended (mostly from health practitioners)  to give their baby water prior to starting solids. What would you recommend to these mothers if they are quite concern their baby is thirsty between the bottles?</p><p>Thank you so so much!</p>]]></message>

<message><![CDATA[<p>Hi Carley, previously many IBCLCs had told me that exclusively breastfed babies (prior to starting solids) should be stooling every single day, ideally multiple times, as this signaled a healthy gut. I was also told that it may be "common" for breastfed babies to not stool everyday, but it is not normal. I was a little surprised to see in the curriculum that it's normal for a breastfed baby to not stool for up to 5 days - as the previous information made sense to me. Just wanted to get more clarification/background on this. Thank you!</p>]]></message>

<message><![CDATA[<p>Dear Carley,</p><p>As here in Europe the guidelines are quite different from the ones in America or the ones of WHO, most of pediatricians and nutritionist follow them so the parents are quite confused. EFSA and ESPGHAN recommend to start solids between 17. and 26. week of life, with special emphasis on babies with anemia who could benefit from starting solids earlier then 6 months. In practice, this is also being advised for babies with reflux.</p><p>What would you suggest as an advice for parents who have child with anemia, that is younger than six months and not yet on solids?</p><p>Many thanks</p>]]></message>

<message><![CDATA[<p>Oh my, unfortunately I answer this few days ago, however I obviously had some connection problem as it didn't post here...</p><p>So, once again, sorry for my late replay and thank you for your comprehensive replay and explanation...</p><p>1. This is so interesting to me, here in Croatia mushrooms for babies are a big no. So the recommendations are to wait until baby turns one year as they are susceptible to microbiological contamination, they are easily perishable and they are hard to digest. Here we are mostly using button mushrooms, oyster mushrooms and porcini mushrooms. For other species like shiitake and truffles the recommendation is to wait until three years of age. What species do you use at N. America?<br>Also, could we recommend mushrooms as valuable source of vitamin D, event if it is in D2 form, especially for vegans?</p><p>2. This for sure makes a lot of sense. However, I talk to a hunter here in my town and he said that the only specie that is being microbiologically tested before consuming is wild boar (because of possibility of trichinosis) and that they are still using lead bullets for all animals. What do you think, if it would be better not to recommend wild game meat then?</p><p>4. Thank you, It makes sense. Most moms I talked with are worried because of toxic substances seeds could contain, but as far as I know, the only little seeds that could be harmful are the apple seeds that contain cyanide and that should be avoided.</p><p>Also, I have few more question:</p><p>1. I often get questions about some supplement that would enhance baby/child immunity. In addition to high quality diet, I recommend some fish oil, vitamin D and probiotics. Here in Croatia, beta-glucans are very popular for that purpose, however I don't know what to think about it. What do you think about it and do you have any other supplement in addition?</p><p>2. It totally makes sense not to introduce water to babies before they begin with solids and mostly the mother who breastfeed don't have problem with this recommendation. However, the mothers who bottle fed their babies are often advised to introduce water earlier. What would you recommend to a mother who is very concerned that here baby is thirsty between two bottles?</p><p>3. There is a recommendation not to reheat certain food for babies (like spinach and carrots) as during reheating process there there is possible formation of potentially harmful compounds. Do you think this is very important thing to advise parents when they think about freezing purees?<br>Also, for how long some puree can stand on room temperature and still considered safe for consuming?<br>Also, moms here often make their own purees or compotes (boiled fruit) and then pasteurize them at home to make it more stable. I suppose this kind of products are much better choice when compared to the ones purchased in supermarket. However, should we be concerned about the nutritional value of this product considering that are cooked for a long time and then pasteurized?</p><p>4. If I understood well, when starting with purees it would be best to start with one ingredient (plus healthy fats) so the baby gets to know the flavor of each food separately and then slowly add more types of food and strive to have all key ingredients of a well balanced puree (carbohydrates, proteins, fats and spices)?</p><p>Thank you so much for your answer, it means a lot to hear what are your opinion on these topics.</p>]]></message>

<message><![CDATA[<p>I was hoping to get some thoughts on dates in late pregnancy for labor. I was looking at the studies and noticed that they are all quite small sample sizes, between 65-150 women. My concern with recommending this is due to the high sugar content around 4.5 grams in a date so 17 grams of sugar in the suggested 4 dates. I'm just curious what your thoughts are on the benefits vs risks of increasing sugar consumption.</p>]]></message>

<message><![CDATA[<p>Hi Ana — 17 weeks is very early, but many pediatricians here in North America still make the outdated recommendation to begin solids at 5 or even 4.5 months (19.5 weeks). As for babies with anemia, one of the most impactful things you can do is actually delayed cord clamping at birth. I shared about this on Instagram today. <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/CNYKeZ0hNHo/" rel="nofollow noopener" title="https://www.instagram.com/p/CNYKeZ0hNHo/">https://www.instagram.com/p...</a></p><p>While knowing that is important to help prevent anemia, admittedly it obviously won't help babies who already have anemia. In this case, in North America, babies are given iron supplementation. This helps raise their levels without having to compromise introducing solids to an immature digestive system. When it comes to resolving anemia through supplementation, our role is to support the care providers dosage recommendations and then support with educating on iron-rich foods once solids have begun, as well as possibly constipation prevention/alleviation — a common side effect of iron supplementation.</p><p>As for reflux, some parents find their baby's reflux improves with the introduction of solid foods, while others find that symptoms actually increase. While there are certain recommendations to make when introducing solids to a baby with reflux, we still don't advise starting before baby reaches the developmental signs of readiness. We're working on adding a lesson on reflux to the curriculum soon!</p>]]></message>

<message><![CDATA[<p>Hi!  i have a client with a baby who is reacting to greek yogurt (spots around mouth/jawline), however they are able to tolerate both ghee and butter without any reaction. i’ve done a bit of research and my thought is, since greek yogurt is more highly processed and has been stripped of its whey, that this baby is actually reacting to the high caesin protein present in the greek yogurt? if they can handle butter which contains little milk proteins, but not greek yogurt(high in caesin), I'm feeling led to conclude that the caesin is the root issue, causing the immune system to have an inflammatory response through the skin. could this be a caesin protein sensitivity?</p><p>this may be common knowledge but i have just recently started incorporated small bits of dairy into my diet (grass-fed butter only) ... so i am learning a lot through this one! just want to make sure i’m drawing the correct conclusions here.</p><p>I plan to have have her eliminate greek yogurt alongside the addition of nutrient rich foods to strengthen the intestinal barrier/gut so to prevent this protein from entering the blood stream.  Because she is tolerating butter and ghee, is it safe to say that she doesnt have to eliminate dairy all together?  rather focus on greek yogurt and then reintroduce?</p>]]></message>

<message><![CDATA[<p>Hi Emma. There are a few things that could potentially be going on here.</p><p>Firstly, yes you're right that it's quite possible this baby is tolerating ghee and butter without complication because they are primarily fat and contain very little milk proteins.</p><p>However, it's also possible that this baby is having a histamine reaction, due to the spotting around the mouth you described. This can occur from fermented foods, such as yogurt, and other non-fermented foods as well.</p><p>The most important question to ask is... is the reaction immediate (minutes - 2 hours), or delayed (2 hours - 3 days)? If it's delayed then the protocol suggests to avoid, rebuild, and reintroduce. Whereas if it's immediate, they should contact their doctor/allergist. Reintroductions is not recommended because  each consecutive reaction could be worse. We don't want to be responsible for suggesting that a baby consume a food they're potentially allergic to.</p><p>BUT in this case, it would be worth exploring if this was a histamine response. I would still suggest they discontinue dairy for now. I would then have them offer a high histamine food, such as naturally fermented sauerkraut (not in a vinegar brine). Advise them to keep a food journal to track any reactions to this and other high histamine foods — such as eggplant, avocado, and cinnamon. There's more in this in the lesson 'Histamine Intolerance' in Module 4.</p><p>- Carley</p>]]></message>

<message><![CDATA[<p>Hi Carley - I have a question regarding picky toddlers. A friend of mine has a 23 month old son who recently began "self harming" by hitting his head against the wall or biting himself pretty hard when throwing a tantrum (tantrums are becoming more severe). While I know this type of behavior can be common amongst toddlers as developmentally they are not quite equipped to process/communicate their big emotions. I was wondering though about supporting her holistically just for my own knowledge and experience as well. She mentioned he has become very picky with foods, especially within the last couple of months - I know he snacks often with processed foods and they eat out a lot. I am wondering if perhaps there is food sensitivities/nutrient deficiencies/inflammation that's also showing up (or exacerbating it) behaviorally as outlined here in the curriculum. I am sure a gut support protocol along with supplementation of the important nutrients listed may be required - but curious in your experience, what is the best way to ensure picky toddlers are still getting their nutrient needs through foods? Have you seen a link in your practice or research of nutrient deficiencies etc showing up behaviorally such as this case? Hopefully this makes sense. Thank you so much!</p>]]></message>

<message><![CDATA[<p>Hi Carley, how do you know if a supplement is organic? I looked at the MegaFood Baby &amp; Me 2 prenatal and it doesn't actually say 'organic' on the bottle. However, I did go onto their website and they have an 'Internal Standard' certification 'Tested for 125+ Pesticides &amp; Herbicides'. Is this the certification it needs to confirm that it is sourced from organic foods?</p>]]></message>

<message><![CDATA[<p>Hi! I have another question :)<br>My client trial participant is currently supplementing with a collagen powder. It is a high-quality source of collagen however, the powder also contains Vitamin C in the form of ascordic acid so, I will advise her against using this specific product. However, the same manufacturer offers the same high-quality collagen on its own in the form of capsules but it does contain 20mg of sodium as well. Is this going to be okay for her (she's 34 weeks pregnant and tries to avoid meat, especially red meat and poultry so collagen is a good source of protein for her)? Thanks in advance :)</p>]]></message>

<message><![CDATA[<p>Hi Carley, my client hasn't yet started solids, however her babe had a bit of mucous in his poop, and it was a little green. She saw her paed, and it was a suspected milk protein allergy. She has since cut dairy from her diet as she exclusively BF. Poop is now yellow, and a little stringy at times. Is stringy normal? Or should she go forward in cutting something else? Will she need to be careful introducing certain foods to her son, or is this something they grow out of? Do you have any good 'poop charts' to have on hand? I see them on the internet a lot, but would like a resource that is trusted by you. :)</p>]]></message>

<message><![CDATA[<p>Hi Carley,</p><p>Can I have a few questions please? :-)</p><p>1. I read that it is not recommended to give babies starchy foods (not just cereals, but also veggies such as potatoes, sweet potatoes, etc.) earlier than 1 year of age and/or having lots of teeth on their mouth, because too young babies are missing an enzyme ptyalin that helps with digestion of starches. What’s your view on this? <a href="https://www.kiwifamilies.co.nz/feeding-babies-starch/" rel="nofollow noopener" title="https://www.kiwifamilies.co.nz/feeding-babies-starch/">https://www.kiwifamilies.co...</a></p><p>2. The amount of food (purees) babies start with should be increased gradually, i.e. for the very first time, start with one spoon (even if the baby wants to eat more) and next day increase to 3 spoons, etc. Is this a bit more gentle approach considering baby’s digestion as he is getting used to solids?</p><p>3. Water- after starting solids, it is here commonly recommended to increase liquid intake up to 150ml even though a baby if still breast/formula fed... breastmilk or formula should keep babies hydrated for the first year, right? Additional liquids in sich amounts would probably be beneficial just when the baby is constipated..?</p><p>What are your thoughts on this, Carley?</p><p>Thanks a lot :) <br>Lucie</p>]]></message>

<message><![CDATA[<p>Hi Rachel, when a supplement is organic it would be labelled on the product, usually with a certification logo. In terms of Mega Foods, here is an example of when the product is organic: <a href="https://www.megafood.com/vitamins-supplements/gummy---d3-1000-iu-25-mcg-bone-muscle-immune-support---mixed-fruit-W1026.html?cgid=vitamins-supplements#start=1" rel="nofollow noopener" title="https://www.megafood.com/vitamins-supplements/gummy---d3-1000-iu-25-mcg-bone-muscle-immune-support---mixed-fruit-W1026.html?cgid=vitamins-supplements#start=1">https://www.megafood.com/vi...</a></p><p>Their Baby &amp; Me 2 does not carry this label, however, most of the vegetables listed on the label are organic. It is also certified as free of all glyphosate residue. Mega Foods are leaders of this distinction in the supplement realm, especially because while organic farming certifications prohibit the use of glyphosate, organic products do not always end up completely free of glyphosate residue.</p><p>This is Mega Foods statement about their organic certification: <a href="https://www.megafood.com/certificates/CERTIFIED_ORGANIC.html" rel="nofollow noopener" title="https://www.megafood.com/certificates/CERTIFIED_ORGANIC.html">https://www.megafood.com/ce...</a><br>While it is the gold standard, it's also worthwhile to consider a companies values and if you trust that they're making all appropriate considerations with the products they produce.</p><p>To be more direct with your question, firstly look at the label. Next look at the manufacturer's website. Lastly, contact the company if you'd still like clarification.</p><p>Hope this helps!</p><p>— Carley</p>]]></message>

<message><![CDATA[<p>Hi Rachel, while other forms of vitamin C are absolutely preferable, ascorbic acid is in so many things that it's pretty hard to avoid completely. In this case I feel that the protein so important for this mother that it's a much bigger benefit than the ascorbic acid is a deterrent. Maybe she could buy the other type and alternate each day until the first form has been used up? The sodium is pretty low in the alternate, with the assumption that it's the amount per serving.</p><p>— Carley</p>]]></message>

<message><![CDATA[<p>Hi Jaimi, glad to hear that the baby is seeing some benefits with the diet changes. This can get a little tricky as there can be multiple causes. We usually only turn to maternal diet changes as a last resort as they can lead to a reduction in breastfeeding duration.</p><p>A few notes...</p><p>Mucus in stool can be  common sign of teething or a cold, occasional mucus is not usually a reason for concern. Although, larger amounts or frequent mucus should be addressed. Is it accompanied by anything else, such as being fussy, hard to console, possible vomiting, or even bloody stool? These would point to milk protein allergy. Stringy stool is actually considered mucus as well. It could also be a cold or teething.</p><p>Mustard yellow is very normal, that's the color of most breastfed baby stool. Bright yellow that is extremely runny or more frequent than usual could be diarrhea. Whereas green stool could be an allergy or green foods in the maternal diet. If it's green and also frothy, then it could be due to an imbalance of hindmilk/foremilk.</p><p>Generally speaking, unless it's an advanced reaction with vomiting or bloody stool, I would suggest introducing allergens as normal. It's the best way to detect a baby's reactions (rather than through maternal diet). That said, if the pediatrician says something different (re introduction), then default to their recommendation.</p><p>– Carley</p>]]></message>

<message><![CDATA[<p>Hi, hoping to get some thoughts. So I definitely see the value in letting labor start on it's own when the mother's body is ready. I am a little bit confused though about at what point we may suggest these more natural interventions as 42 weeks is the maximum gestation allowed where I am for example. Do you have thoughts on which tend to be the safest and most efficacious while honoring that nature has its own timing? And I'm curious why acupressure is listed under higher pressure.</p><p>Thanks, Janine</p>]]></message>

<message><![CDATA[<p>You're absolutely right. It would be great to allow the body to start the birth process when it's ready but there's usually always great pressure from providers. I think it's very helpful and relieving to remember that it's not "up to us" to decide when the right time to start natural interventions. It would be more of an open discussion with your client, first expressing the benefits of waiting as long as possible, but also being able to support with low risk "interventions" when it's a last resort before medical intervention. I'd start with the lowest risk but not before at least 40 weeks, longer if possible. As "unscientific" as this may sound, I've also found that the client feels drawn to one particular method over another and I try to allow space for that intuition. As for acupressure, it is misleading under the "high-risk" lesson. I meant to include in comparison to with acupuncture but it's not considered high-risk itself. I'll move it to the low-risk folder. Thanks for pointing this out.</p><p>– Carley</p>]]></message>

<message><![CDATA[<p>Hi Kelly, firstly congrats to your client and reaching 22 weeks with PCOS. Great question you've asked. The considerations would be that those with PCOS are at an increased risk for high blood pressure/preeclampsia and gestational diabetes.</p><p>As it's so important for those with PCOS to be mindful of their blood sugar, and seeing as they're at risk for gestation diabetes, I would recommend following the protocol for GD.</p><p>Whereas, I would suggest monitoring blood pressure (as they will at each prenatal check up) and then implementing suggestions as needed. Being proactive about this can reduce the risk of developing preeclampsia.</p><p>Thinking down the line, as those with PCOS are also at higher risk of having a baby with macrosomia (larger-than-average birth weight), I would encourage this client to move as her body directs during labor and birth, rather than on her back. This reduces the risk of shoulder dystocia (baby's shoulder getting stuck during labor), which frequently leads to cesarean section.</p><p>Of course, these are all the "risks" but always be mindful to share this info in a way that helps her to feel empowered by being proactive rather than scaring her with "worst-case" outcomes.</p><p>– Carley</p>]]></message>

<message><![CDATA[<p>Hi Lucie, ohh such a great question! We're actually working on adding a section about reflux into the curriculum. We've had many requests and I also have a lot to share on the topic. As for this question, babies do tend to have a reduction in reflux once they start solids. While we have evidence of that, the information I have about purees vs BLW is actually more anecdotal. There are some mother's who have had 2 children with reflux, and started with different feeding methods but found no difference. However, I'd say a larger percentage are more in support of purees for reflux.</p><p>I try to stay neutral on feeding methods, but in my heart I'm a BLW fan myself. Yet, solids seem to minimize reflux and those who are spoon-fed tend to "get more in" in the first few weeks. Whereas, for those who self-fed it tends to be more exploratory in the beginning. I think a great balance would be to spoon-feed AND also let baby explore finger foods. While being *very* mindful not to overfeed baby in an effort to "dampen" the reflux. Be ever so respectful of fullness cues.</p>]]></message>

<message><![CDATA[<p>Thank you so much for your detailed reply. The green mucousy poops are gone, and the vomiting has definitely slowed down to about once a week, instead of the same time daily. So she is assuming it's the dairy baby was reacting to. What is generally the next food group to limit if she wanted to make changes to her maternal diet? Would it be soy/ grains? She is one determined mumma. Or maybe the odd vomit is unrelated? She follows a very good postpartum diet, lots of healthy fats, healthy carbohydrates and proteins. But good to know what mucous can mean other things other than an allergy as well, thank you!!!</p>]]></message>

<message><![CDATA[<p>Ah yes, it sounds like it was diary. If there has been such a significant improvement (and vomiting was/is involved) then I suggest referring to an allergist when introducing solids with baby. If the mother would like to test another food, she can try another one of the top allergens. I would recommend soy first as it often coincides with milk protein allergy. Only 1 new one at a time though (so not soy &amp; gluten together), as results from elimination/reintroduction is more difficult to track via breastfeed baby rather than with baby directly. No need to do "all grains" rather gluten-containing grains only.</p><p>Steps to take:<br>Remove one new food. If you’ve identified the problem food, you may see an improvement in as soon as a few days. However, wait a full 3+ weeks. If you see no improvement, add the food back into your diet, monitor for changes. Then remove another food.</p><p>— Also wanted to note in the event that another student reviews this thread: vomiting doesn't *always* = allergies, but in this frequency and pattern it seems to be a likely culprit.</p>]]></message>

<message><![CDATA[<p>This is actually something we discuss in great length in the pregnancy &amp; postpartum courses. A breastfeed baby will get the iodine they require from breast milk but only if the mother is well nourished, so there should be an emphasis there (on maternal diet) — and in pregnancy as well. Formula also contains sufficient levels. This is more of a concern for babies who don't eat meat dairy, or eggs. Incorporating low-sodium seaweed flakes to babies diet when possible is beneficial.</p>]]></message>

<message><![CDATA[<p>Hi Lucie,</p><p>1. Ah yes that is circulating around and seemed to have an uptick in popularity with the rise of paleo/keto. While I do suggest avoiding refined grains, and actually delaying grains with babies — I'm not in the camp that believes all starches are necessary to avoid.</p><p>A few studies that refute this:</p><p>- At 1 month, baby’s pancreas has already started to make amylase and reaches adult levels at 6 – 12 months <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23812516/" rel="nofollow noopener" title="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23812516/">https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih...</a><br>- At 3 months, baby’s saliva contains almost as much amylase as an adult <a href="https://academic.oup.com/ajcn/article-abstract/39/4/584/4691188" rel="nofollow noopener" title="https://academic.oup.com/ajcn/article-abstract/39/4/584/4691188">https://academic.oup.com/aj...</a><br>- Breast milk contains amylase, which is used in the small intestine <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/1701531/" rel="nofollow noopener" title="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/1701531/">https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih...</a></p><p>Finally, I'm not usually in alignment with what this author shares, but I do appreciate this article (well, most of it - some of not so much) <a href="https://scienceofmom.com/2013/11/08/amylase-in-infancy-can-babies-digest-starch/" rel="nofollow noopener" title="https://scienceofmom.com/2013/11/08/amylase-in-infancy-can-babies-digest-starch/">https://scienceofmom.com/20...</a></p><p>2. I'm in support of feeding by baby's hunger cues. However, a few tastes in the beginning, rather than whole huge meals right off the bat is a gentle approach. It don't feel it has to be as calculated as "one spoon, 3 spoons" etc. Just offer a few tastes for a few days and naturally build up, following baby's cues.</p><p>3. I would definitely avoid this much non-nutritive liquid in fear that it would displace nutrient dense breast milk/formula and foods. A few sips here and there is really all baby needs when starting solids.</p>]]></message>

<message><![CDATA[<p>This was super helpful! Thank you, OB Team.  Her little one was having delayed reactions (about a day later) and was also reacting to soy milk (diarrhea and splotches on her legs...about a day later as well).  She was able to tolerate tempeh with no reaction, however.  I did some research and found that soybeans are higher in histamine, so it leads me to believe this could in fact be a histamine intolerance as you suggest. However, I was surprised that tempeh was okay, as I am learning that fermented foods tend to be higher in histamine?  Wouldn't she likely have the same reaction, or is it just that some histamine containing foods are more tolerable than others?</p><p>Do you recommend that she remove ALL dairy AND soy products?  or ALL high histamine foods? then rebuild, and then reintroduce a high histamine food like sauerkraut and then gauge for a reaction? Essentially, would I be following the elimination diet for food sensitivities (multiple foods : dairy and soy)</p>]]></message>

<message><![CDATA[<p>Hi Carley - my volunteer client's intake form mentions that her 14 month old son is still drinking formula as she suspects a milk sensitivity causing eczema. I know the curriculum states that their nutritional needs can be met through a diverse whole foods diet at this age, but just wanted to check in on your thoughts on formula after the age of 1 (as we know that continuing breastmilk has many benefits). If eliminating formula, would coconut milk be an acceptable substitution in this situation as we work on baby's gut health? We have not had our consultation yet, but my hunch is that maybe he is not quite ready to drop the bottle entirely.</p>]]></message>

I was looking for a UL for magnesium and found this article - <a href="https://ods.od.nih.gov/fact" rel="nofollow noopener" title="https://ods.od.nih.gov/fact">https://ods.od.nih.gov/fact</a>.... It states that the supplemental UL for healthy, pregnant/lactating female, 19+ years old) = 350mg/day however the course material lists the daily requirement as 355mg/day. One of the supplement recommendations I made will bring my client's supplemental magnesium up to 360mg (from magnesium glycinate and organic algae). Is there a risk of toxicity? I feel that there won't be I wanted to triple check.</p>]]></message>

<message><![CDATA[<p>Hi Carley,</p><p>Again me with a 'few' questions :).</p><p>1. I read that it is an option to put some food on baby's forearm and look for some reaction, if the baby is considered as high risk... What do you think about this method? Could it be helpful in some situations?</p><p>2. Should this strict hypo-allergenic approach be recommended to all babies considered as high-risk or there are some exceptions?</p><p>3. I understand the difference between food allergy and sensitivity... However, how can we know if some symptoms are due to food sensitivity or intolerance? I suppose that children don't have intolerance so often or? Can the healing protocol help with intolerance as well?</p><p>4. Could you please give me some link where I could read more on food allergy/sensitivity?</p><p>5. I don't know if situation is similar at North America, but here in Croatia we have a lot of children who are dealing with enlarged tonsils. Most of them undergo surgery because of that. Is there a possibility that it is linked in some way with food allergy or sensitivity? Could this be one of the symptom?</p><p>Many thanks,<br>Ana</p>]]></message>

<message><![CDATA[<p>Thanks for being so diligent and triple checking. How magnesium from the organic algae contributes to her daily intake? Even though it is a supplement, this type of magnesium is actually considered a "food form". Regardless, while the NIH states 350mg as the UL for supplemental magnesium, this is very conservative and is in place to reduce risk of diarrhea, nausea, and abdominal cramping. These are primarily from high doses of magnesium carbonate, chloride, gluconate, and oxide. Whereas toxicity is typically seen at doses of more than 5,000 mg/day.</p><p>We factored many considerations in when creating our daily requirement recommendations. We're actually creating a resource that lists all ULs for each nutrient as well!</p>]]></message>

<message><![CDATA[<p>I'm assuming the formula is not hypoallergenic or dairy-free? Otherwise it may be contributing if milk/dairy is a factor in the eczema. I would encourage you to inquire if the mother feels that the child has a well-rounded diet or if the formula is potentially filling and nutritional gaps. She may feel ready to drop the formula but just needs permission to know it's okay. If it is filling nutritional gaps, coconut milk wouldn't be an appropriate substitution. We also wouldn't want anything (like a milk substitute) "filling" the child up and leaving less room for the necessary nutrient-dense foods he needs. If formula is needed for nutrition, I'd switch to a hypoallergenic brand. If they're ready to drop the formula, I'd keep milk substitute to an occasional "comfort bottle", not a "substitute". Good luck with the consult!</p><p>– Carley</p>]]></message>

A mindful introduction of allergenic foods will generally be supportive of those with moderate to severe eczema and/or asthma.</p><p>Food intolerances manifest as gastrointestinal symptoms, and unlike food sensitivities can be tested by a medical, functional, or naturopathic doctor.

Is it just about being more specific with the foods (I might be overthinking it)?</p>]]></message>

<message><![CDATA[<p>Hi Amanda,</p><p>Food aversions generally occur with morning sickness, hyperemesis gravidarum, or in cases of extensive aversions. It can be helpful to ask if your client is experiencing additional food aversions at this time.</p><p>I recommend a gentle focus on nutrient-dense foods and/or meals, while being diligent to check-in with your client. Asking questions like, “Do these recommendations resonate with you?” and/or “Can you see yourself implementing this?” will help determine if your client is likely to follow through on your recommendations, or if an alternative suggestion may be beneficial.</p><p>Protein is an excellent topic to delve into with your client! She may even find that her meat aversion resolves in the second trimester. Would your client be open to consuming fish and/or eggs? Both of these sources would help satisfy her protein requirements and provide other important pregnancy-related nutrients. Alternatively, a smoothie with nut butter and collagen powder would help to promote more quality protein in her diet.</p><p>- Chantel</p>]]></message>

<message><![CDATA[<p>Hi! Question about young babies who are exclusively breastfed but are experiencing eczema. <br> If mom is on strict elimination diet already, would the best way to help start supporting baby's symptoms be to examine and then manage the babies toxic load?  Through the course material, I feel confident making suggestions to those with babies who have begun solids and how we can support them internally through nutrient dense gut supporting foods, but would love some more guidance on how to navigate something like this if say the baby has not yet begun solids and is exclusively breastfed?</p><p>Would our focus be on Mom and what she can add/eliminate from her diet?  Avoiding dairy, allergens and other inflammatory foods? Adding quality Probiotic, Omega 3s (if not already getting from diet), Vit D if levels aren't sufficient, so to enhance her breastmilk and support baby?</p><p>Or on external stressors and managing baby's toxic load?<br>Things like antibiotic use, assessing cleaning products used in/around the house/dry climate, dust, pet dander, soaps and creams currently used on baby, clothing, etc.</p><p>Or a combination of both?</p>]]></message>

<message><![CDATA[<p>Hi Kelly, thanks for your patience with my reply!</p><p>Iron polymaltose is a combination of ferric iron with maltol. Maltol is a food additive used primarily as a flavour enhancer and is not a form of chelated iron. I would prefer if this supplement did not contain artificial flavour, preservatives, sorbitol, and would advise against the consumption of ethanol during pregnancy. However, there is no need to concern your client with this information if she is currently supplementing with Maltofer. It is likely safe, though I would generally not recommend the continuation of this supplement.</p><p>- Chantel</p>]]></message>

<message><![CDATA[<p>Hi Ana, Carley here. Presently we only have the data to link enlarged/swollen tonsils (without a fever) with food or seasonal allergies, but not with food sensitivities. However, it may be because the scientific community hasn't been able to agree on what they deem to be a "food sensitivity" as of yet. So while it's possible and we don't want to rule it out — we don't have the data to support the correlation.</p>]]></message>

<message><![CDATA[<p>Hi Emma, great question!</p><p>The conservative recommendation for babies under the age of 12-months is less than 400mg of sodium daily. This equates to approximately 1-gram of table salt. However, it is important to factor in the sodium content of breastmilk, formula, and solids. Both breastmilk and formula contain approximately 200mg of sodium per 24-ounces.</p><p>Many health advisories recommend strict avoidance of added sugar in foods and/or beverages for children under the age of two. This can be tremendously difficult to implement with so many hidden sugars found in foods; however it is the going recommendation.</p><p>‒ Chantel</p>]]></message>

<message><![CDATA[<p>Hi Cesca, great questions!</p><p>Manufacturers are not required to list ingredients as ‘synthetic’ on labels. While we cannot guarantee that the source is not synthetic without contacting the manufacturer, we can generally *assume* that the fish oil is sourced from fish. It may be more likely to be synthetic if listed as ‘docosahexaenoic acid’.</p><p>You are correct in recognizing that both GOS and FOS are prebiotic substances. We generally recommend additional supplementation for formula-fed babies if the parent’s are open to it. This will help to support their digestive and immune systems, similarly to the beneficial bacteria present in breast milk.</p><p>‒ Chantel</p>]]></message>

<message><![CDATA[<p>Hi Theresa,</p><p>This is a unique and complex conversation that will be included in our upcoming OBA Fertility Course. The most common recommendation is to wait 3-months following pregnancy loss. This provides space for a woman's uterus to heal and her menstruation cycle to regulate again. In contrast, the World Health Organization recommends a 6-month period of time; however, this may not be necessary for all women. Especially if the miscarriage occurs early in the first trimester without complications. In this case it is advised to wait for a woman to feel physically recovered, for her menstruation cycle to return, and to have sufficient time for the grieving process. This timeline will be unique for each woman navigating conception after pregnancy loss, and may even be earlier than 3-months for some.</p><p>‒ Chantel</p>]]></message>

<message><![CDATA[<p>Hi Carley - I just finished the client consultation for food sensitivities/eczema. I have a couple questions. First, she already identified the trigger food as being milk (whole and 2%). Is it still OK to use this client for my trial as we are still going through the gut support protocol? Secondly, her son is 14 months and she is still giving him formula - I looked it up and it contains nonfat milk and lactose. He's been drinking this since he is 1 month old with no reactions. As soon as she introduced whole/2% milk, eczema popped up and as soon as she eliminated it, his eczema cleared up and has not returned. I found that very interesting/confusing so just wanted to get your expertise. THank you!</p>]]></message>

<message><![CDATA[<p>Hi Emma,</p><p>It’s much more difficult to support an exclusively breastfed baby in comparison to a baby directly. The primary concern being that a strict maternal diet may negatively influence her milk supply. However, if a mother is wanting to test an additional food, it can be helpful to eliminate one of the top allergenic food sources. The most common culprit tends to be dairy, so this would be an excellent place to start! Once a trigger food has been identified, a client may notice significant improvement in their baby’s eczema in mere days. However, it can take up to 3-weeks to fully eliminate the respective protein from the body. A full 3+ weeks of elimination should take place before evaluating the results or performing a re-introduction test. If no improvement is observed in the baby’s eczema, the food may be introduced back into the mother’s diet and monitored for changes. An additional allergenic source may be tested at this time.</p><p>Your maternal supplementation protocol is spot on! I would also encourage the mother to supplement her baby with probiotics to help improve digestive and immune function. In regards to reducing a baby's overall toxic load, this can be an impactful area to support if parents are open to additional recommendations. If not, I would recommend focusing on your thoughtful dietary changes and supplemental additions.</p><p>‒ Chantel</p>]]></message>

<message><![CDATA[<p>Dear Carley,</p><p>I found a client so I would just like to check with you is it ok to include him in my client trial. So it is a 16-months old baby boy who had eczema patches for few weeks and then he had an large urticaria. The parents did not have clear idea of the trigger food but they suspected it could be dairy. Their pediatrician sent them to a prick test and on RAST and the only results they got is that he is allergic to tuna (he didn't try it so far) and to oranges (he is consuming them regulary).<br>Since then they eliminated oranges, and the eczema is better, however he is still having urticaria when consuming dairy (mostly because of cream cheese, there is mostly no reaction to yoghurt). I think this could be a food sensitivity and the baby could benefit from this gut healing protocol, what do you think?</p><p>Many thanks<br>Ana</p>]]></message>

<message><![CDATA[<p>Hi Carley, I am currently looking for a suitable client for the client trial 2. I have a potential baby for the food sensitivity client trial but I'm not entirely sure if it would be appropriate?! The baby is now 11months old and did have a milk protein sensitivity when he was younger and the mom had to cut dairy too. At around 9 months they got the okay from their pediatrician to start feeding him small amounts of dairy again and it seems he's been tolerating it fine now. But now the mom noticed that he had a mild reaction the one time she gave him eggplants, his lips and cheeks got red and blotchy, so she didn't tried it again since. I'm wondering if the baby maybe has a histamine intolerance, since I figured out eggplant is high in histamine... But since the reaction on eggplants was immediate, I'm wondering if this baby would be a good fit for the client trial, because it would be considered as an allergy then. Anyway I feel like this mom and baby, especially with the "dairy sensitivity history" could benefit a lot from a consultation, rebuilding and doing a healing protocol. Thanks for your advise, if I can take this client for the trial or not?</p>]]></message>

<message><![CDATA[<p>Hi Jelena ‒ this can be an easy topic to get wrapped into! Generally speaking, the absorbability of nutrients is not something to be notably concerned with. This holds especially true for client’s that do not present with significant nutrient deficiencies.</p><p>In the case that a client is diagnosed with anemia, for example, it can be helpful to recommend the separation of meat and dairy. However, I would be mindful that this information be shared in a way that does not become all-consuming or removes the enjoyment from eating for your client.</p><p>Plant-based sources, like chia seeds, can contain calcium and anti-nutrients that reduce the absorbability of non-heme iron. This is one of the many reasons why plant-based dietary rhythms can take more thoughtful consideration in regards to nutrient absorption and/or additional supplementation.</p><p>‒ Chantel</p>]]></message>

<message><![CDATA[<p>Hi Janine, thanks for your patience with my reply! We are not currently receiving notifications for this discussion board and are looking further into the matter.</p><p>You are absolutely correct in recognizing that these nutrients, along with many other nutrients discussed in the curriculum, are important for the entire duration of pregnancy. The reason that they are listed in the third trimester is that they become even more important in terms of supplementation - above and beyond someone who is not pregnant. As an example, calcium is listed as a third trimester nutrient even though it is needed throughout the first trimester, as it would be for a non-pregnant woman.</p><p>With that said, it is unrealistic for most women, and also often unadvisable, to supplement with all of these nutrients in pregnancy. As such, we have identified which ones are of primary importance during specific trimesters. If your client is open to it, an additional vitamin D3, omega 3, and/or probiotic could be beneficial! There are also instances where this may be of greater importance, such as for those who are deficient and/or do not consume sufficient dietary sources.</p><p>We will be including the Recommended Dietary Allowances for non-pregnant women in the curriculum soon to contrast the requirements during pregnancy.</p><p>‒ Chantel</p>]]></message>

<message><![CDATA[<p>Hi Lucie, great questions!</p><p>It’s best to begin with an open cup around 6-months of age with parental assistance. I recommend offering small sips at a time to avoid potential spills. Once baby can successfully swallow small amounts of water from an open cup with assistance, you can then move onto a cup with a straw and/or offer both interchangeably. These are thought to be better for baby’s development than hard-spout or spill-proof cups. Furthermore, straws that support the upright alignment of a baby’s head and encourage an upward sucking motion are generally thought to be better than cups requiring a baby’s head to lean back.</p><p>In regards to purees, you can begin with pre-loaded utensils as early as 6-months. However, I do encourage mindfulness around providing opportunities to explore the textures and taste profiles with their hands too! I personally recommend sourcing utensils with short handles and smooth edges. Baby-safe silicone spoons are an excellent option, along with the Pre-Spoon GOOtensils that can be found at: <a href="https://numnumbaby.us/pages/pre-spoon-gootensils-glacier-storm" rel="nofollow noopener" title="https://numnumbaby.us/pages/pre-spoon-gootensils-glacier-storm">https://numnumbaby.us/pages...</a></p><p>‒ Chantel</p>]]></message>

However, it is generally sufficient to test with cow’s milk as there is more than a 90% likelihood that a baby with a cow’s milk allergy reacts similarly to that of goat, sheep, or buffalo milk. With that said, it is possible for a baby with a cow’s milk sensitivity to develop a tolerance to goat, sheep, and/or buffalo milk.</p><p>In regards to your second question, it is generally recommended to introduce these foods as part of a mindful allergenic schedule into and before 12-months of age.

<message><![CDATA[<p>Thanks Chantel. The baby has completed the soy ladder and is part way through the milk ladder. The client is confused about how much to push on through the milk ladder when her baby is still experiencing the symptoms (mainly discomfort and diarrhea). His symptoms are still suggesting that there are problems. With soy, he got through the soy ladder faster but as their family don't eat much soy she is unsure whether or not to keep feeding it to her baby regularly, just to keep up the exposure level.</p><p>I suppose my confusion with this case is that the baby has been diagnosed by a doctor with allergies (CMPA and Soy) at 8 weeks -&gt; not food sensitivities. However, the symptoms she is describing (now that baby is older - 11 months - and eating solids) are more indicative of a sensitivity (diarrhea). Whilst the CMPA / soy allergy would be out of my scope as a CNC, can I still support this client?</p><p>The baby has also had eczema in the past, although is not currently suffering from it, so I don't think that would count for the requirements either.</p>]]></message>

<message><![CDATA[<p>Hello!</p><p>Hoping to get some clarity on the supplement dosage for babies and how much is safe to recommend for the following:</p><p>-Liver Capsules (in the course material it says no more than 1/4 capsule to be offered to baby).  I personally take Liver Capsules from Ancestral Supplements and after reaching out to the owner I've found out that there is only 2mg of Iron in a serving (6 capsules).  If the serving size is multiple pills, how would we consider how much to offer a baby?  In this case, less than 1/4 capsule is very little iron.  I'd assume it would be best to obtain from whole foods rather?</p><p>-Omega 3's. Generally how much is a safe recommendation for baby? I take Carlson Norwegian Fish Oil supplement (1tsp) that contains 1,600 mg of Omegas. 800mg EPA 500mg DHA.  Is that safe amount for baby too?</p><p>Vitamin D</p>]]></message>

<message><![CDATA[<p>I absolutely love that you reached out to the company ‒ Carley has spoken with them before too! It is always best to consume iron from whole food sources when possible; however, to meet baby’s iron requirements through liver capsules would provide them with a little bit too much vitamin A. While the iron content may indeed be low, it offers many additional nutrient benefits and a more bioavailable source of iron. This is ultimately why we recommend ¼ capsule as a nutrient-dense bonus to meals.</p><p>Generally speaking, the Adequate Intake (AI) for baby’s up to 12-months is 0.5g of omega 3s. I would recommend offering ⅓ tsp of your chosen Norwegian Fish Oil supplement as baby will likely be receiving additional omega 3s from breast milk and/or formula milk. 0.5g will be an adequate measurement that does not near the Tolerable Upper Intake Level (UL).</p><p>‒ Chantel</p>]]></message>

<message><![CDATA[<p>Hi Vivienne,</p><p>According to BioGaia, the Lactobacillus reuteri strain has shown particularly promising for baby’s with colic. It is important to acknowledge that this study was funded by BioGaia and they do have a patent on the Lactobacillus reuteri strain. However, it is the only available research that we have connecting probiotics and colic currently. Probiotics can be offered to newborns and beyond.</p><p>I am curious if your client is located in Canada or the States?

<message><![CDATA[<p>Hi Theresa ‒ we delve into protein requirements during the Pregnancy Nutrition course (Module 2: Second Trimester Macronutrient Feature). The current RDA for non-lactating adults is 0.8g per kilogram of body weight. Based on the information we have available, it is recommended that lactating women include an additional 14.7g for the first 6-months postpartum, followed by an additional 11.8g in the subsequent 6-months.</p><p>‒ Chantel</p>]]></message>

<message><![CDATA[<p>Hi Amanda ‒ we are in the midst of developing a protocol for varicose veins and it will be included in the curriculum soon! Listed below are recommendations to support client's with varicose veins:</p><p>Vitamin C: Vitamin C is used to manufacture collagen and elastin which helps to repair and maintain the elasticity of veins. It is important to remain mindful of the upper tolerable intake limit of 2000mg daily during pregnancy.</p><p>Exercise: Regular, low-to-moderate impact exercise, such as walking or jogging, can improve muscular strength and circulation. However, do keep in mind that strenuous exercise and being on one’s feet for long stretches may aggravate varicose veins. Encourage your client to limit standing to approximately 30-minutes if possible and shift their weight from one leg to another every few minutes.</p><p>Elevate the legs: Your client can lie or sit with their legs elevated above the heart to promote circulation a few times per day if possible. I also recommend encouraging your client to avoid crossing their legs when sitting as this restricts blood flow.</p><p>Support socks or hose: There are many effective, lightweight options for optimal comfort and support. Otherwise, your client should avoid wearing tight clothes that constrict her waist, groin, or legs.</p><p>Prevention: Help your client follow the recommendations put forth in the Constipation protocol, as straining to have a bowel movement may constrict the deep veins in her legs and can worsen or even cause spider veins and varicose veins.</p><p>‒ Chantel</p>]]></message>

<message><![CDATA[<p>Hi Rachel ‒ thanks for your patience with my reply! We unfortunately did not receive a notification for this post and are looking further into the matter. These are excellent food and beverage options to support your client’s experience with mastitis and mild postpartum anxiety. It can also be helpful to ensure that your client is readily consuming foods rich in omega 3s (both DHA and EPA), iron, vitamin D3, and vitamin B12 as deficiencies in these nutrients can negatively influence mental health.</p><p>‒ Chantel</p>]]></message>

<message><![CDATA[<p>Hi @carleymendes:disqus  I wanted to ask for some clarification on this case again please (apologies, it's a complicated one). I was trying to craft a response to my volunteer to explain why I would not be able to support her for the client trial, which has got me revisiting the material re: an allergy. vs a food sensitivity.</p><p>I have also been looking into CMPA and found this information:</p><p>"The other type of milk allergy happens when symptoms are ‘delayed’ (slow to appear) and are caused by a different part of the immune system reacting in a different way. This type of reaction is described as Non-IgE mediated food allergy and is the most common type."</p><p>From what I had learnt about my prospective client, the baby's symptoms would be classed as 'delayed' because the main issue is diarrhoea which I would have thought is driven by a non-IgE reaction.</p><p>Therefore, if I were to keep the soy allergy out of scope for the client trial, would it be suitable to work with this client from the perspective of a cow's milk sensitivity because (a) there is not the risk of anaphylaxis in the case of a non-IgE mediated allergy and (b) there seems to be a stronger link with gut-health.</p><p>If the answer is still no in this case, that's OK too - but perhaps you could please help me with an explanation I can provide to the client as to why I am unable to help them. (I had initially planned to explain that in the case of an allergy, as the symptoms are unpredictable and life threatening in extreme cases they should seek advice from their doctor before reintroducing food).</p><p>Thank you, I'm a little lost with this one so any help would be much appreciated</p>]]></message>

<message><![CDATA[<p>Hi Emma ‒ we are more than happy to help! The recommended dietary allowance of vitamin C for a 7 to 12-month-old is 50mg with an upper limit of 400mg between 1 and 3-years. An average baby at 12-months weighs approximately 20lbs, which would be 7.5 times less than an 150-pound adult. Based on this information, you would divide 1000mg by 7.5 which equates to 133.33mg. The appropriate dose of camu camu powder, for this particular 12-month-old, would be around 130mg. I hope this helps to empower your understanding!</p><p>‒ Chantel</p>]]></message>

<message><![CDATA[<p>Hi Sofia,</p><p>I much prefer introducing whole foods one at a time to help determine the timeline of the reaction as well as the potential food trigger. This will help to establish the best course of action pending on if the trigger is a food allergy or food sensitivity. Early, repeated exposure to common allergens can help to reduce risk; however, the single food method can be done with increased mindfulness and tracked more readily. I believe the single food method to be an especially beneficial course for a baby that is reacting to a mother’s breast milk.</p><p>‒ Chantel</p>]]></message>

<message><![CDATA[<p>Dear Chantel,</p><p>I would just like to check something regarding this future client. So, considering that the baby boy is experiencing both eczema and occasional urticaria (food sensitivity, probably to dairy) I should firstly implement the elimination diet for eczema, until there is no eczema left, a then re-introduce the suspect trigger food and look for a flare up... An then when the protocol is finished and successful, we should move to urticaria and apply food sensitivity protocol, or? I suppose maybe the trigger food is the same food but again, just to check.</p><p>Many thanks in advance,<br>Ana</p>]]></message>

<message><![CDATA[<p>Hi Ana, you're right... soluble fiber can be very beneficial for relieving and avoiding constipation. While this can be true for babies as well, more isn't better in this case. Most babies can't handle too much fiber too soon for a few reasons. Firstly, breast milk/formula doesn't contain fiber, so their digestive system has to become accustomed to this. Fermentable fibers are digested by bacteria in the gut, and babies are still building their microbiome. Blending fiber rich foods can help break them down. However, baby *may* consume "more" if blended. However, fiber usually isn't a great concern and I'd explore the other remedies first before monitoring fiber intake.</p><p>And yes — application directly on the nipple is suitable for probiotics. It's not that they're "activated" by liquid. It's more for ease of consumption, as powder is difficult to consume on its own.</p>]]></message>

<message><![CDATA[<p>Hello, I have a volunteer client lined up for the beginning solids trial. On the health intake form  my client has mentioned a suspected CMPI and soy intolerance. This baby had some mucus in stool and was green, and was spitting up once/twice per day. Client is exclusively BF, and has conducted a strict maternal elimination diet. Baby's stools have since returned to yellow and far far less mucousy. Baby no longer spits up. She has been told it can be genetics, and has since found out her husband had same issue.</p><p>My question is - because it is an intolerance, and not a confirmed allergy - am I able to use this client? I also read below in the comment thread about reintroducing dairy into maternal diet, but you suggested if baby is to start solids soon - maybe hold out and do it directly through baby?</p><p>Thank you</p>]]></message>

<message><![CDATA[<p>This is a truly excellent consideration, Janine! It can be helpful to begin with an open-nature question. For example, “Do you have any questions or concerns around the risks associated with certain foods during pregnancy, such as undercooked eggs or raw fish?”. If your client expresses interest, this would help to open-up the discussion around the risks associated with pregnancy. It is also important to feel out your client and gauge what information would be appropriate. In the case of dark leafy greens, you can certainly share it as an example. However, it might not be necessary to mention the risk associated with greens at all. Especially if the client is noticeably anxious during consultation.</p><p>‒ Chantel</p>]]></message>

<message><![CDATA[<p>Thanks for checking ‒ this baby would satisfy the requirements for the ‘Starting Solids’ client trial as long as there is increased mindfulness around the introduction of dairy and soy.

<message><![CDATA[<p>Hi Ana,</p><p>It can be confusing to assemble the puzzle pieces, admittedly. However, they do become more clear with practice. If a client is exhibiting reactions to eggplant, tomato, and citrus fruits it would also be indicative of high histamine levels. Both eggplant and tomato are high histamine-containing foods, while citrus triggers the release of histamine.</p><p>The OBA Team is currently assembling a chart that considers all of the possible reactions, what they mean, how to determine them, along with their most appropriate course of action. We will notify students when this is made available in the curriculum.</p><p>‒ Chantel</p>]]></message>

<message><![CDATA[<p>Hi Oh Baby Team!</p><p>I was wondering, what would be the schedule for starting solids for a high-risk baby and for a low-risk baby? In the course, it is written that the approach of introducing one food at a time (non-allergenic ones) is not necessary with low risk babies. Does it mean I can introduce new food each day or even food combinations right from the start? For example: Day 1 - zucchini, Day 2 - avocado, etc.?</p><p>When the baby is considered a high-risk, would it be better to take the food introduction slow and introduce one non-allergenic food at a time and serve it to the baby for 3 days and then move to another food on day 4?</p><p>How long should I be introducing non-allergenic foods before I introduce the first allergenic food to the baby (both high and low risk baby)? And how many kinds of non-allergenic foods should a baby try before trying the first allergenic one? And when is it best that babies have their first meat?</p><p>Would you consider a baby, who had a cradle cap and a few dry patches of eczema on feet and hands as a high-risk baby?</p><p>Thank you soooo much for clarifying this for me!!! :-)<br>Lucie x</p>]]></message>

<message><![CDATA[<p>Hi Carley,</p><p>I have a client trial participant with a 4-month-old whose doctor has recommended he start solids soon based on the following:<br>- testing confirmed he has lost his tongue thrust reflex<br>- he has great neck/head control with minimal support<br>- he is in the 92nd percentile for weight, and 96th percentile for height<br>- the doctor's main reason for recommending solids early is "based on his development"</p><p>The client also feels that his coordination and control of objects is good for example, he can hold his bottle and drink it himself (when it's half full - he is formula-fed).</p><p>My question is, how do I support this client who I feel has already been convinced by her doctor to start solids? I did think about reminding her of the WHO recommendations for exclusively feeding with milk until 6 months old (because it seems he has met the Developmental Signs of Readiness) but I do want to be supportive rather than try to change her mind.</p><p>It seems that as CNCs we will constantly be met with "well, my doctor said...".

<message><![CDATA[<p>It certainly does! For a low-risk baby you can even combine two or three low-risk foods into one meal (i.e. zucchini, avocado, and peas). Our recommendation for introducing non-allergenic foods one at a time would only be necessary for a baby that is considered especially high-risk. This would be defined as a baby with a family history of multiple allergies. It would not be necessary for high-risk infants who have moderate eczema as this is their only qualification within the category of ‘high-risk’.</p><p>The introduction of non-allergenic food generally spans the course of 2-weeks. However, this will be different for every baby and is truthfully more for the parents so that their baby’s first food exposure does not result in an allergic reaction. A baby should be introduced to enough meals that they feel comfortable with the process of eating ‒ there are no specific guidelines for the amounts or types of non-allergenic foods to be introduced. Having said this, a handful of low-risk foods is generally an appropriate recommendation.</p><p>In regards to your question on cradle cap, it is actually a topical yeast that is unrelated to food allergies. The addition of eczema would also have to be moderate to severe in order to be considered as high-risk.</p><p>I hope this helps to provide further clarification!</p><p>‒ Chantel</p>]]></message>

So, I talked to a mom who has a baby who is 4 months old, breastfeeding... Her baby had a blood in her stool in the first months and it was due to dairy. When the mother removed all dairy product from her diet the problem resolved and the baby is now perfectly fine... Does this blood in her stools mean there is a certain allergy to dairy? What would be the best way to advise parents in this situation, should we recommend allergy test to dairy before introducing it or?</p><p>2. If the baby is allergic to dairy, can she/he have animals that consume it (I don't known the right word :)? For example, veal?</p><p>3. Here in Croatia, it is usual practice of pediatrician to send most of babies/toddlers dealing with severe eczema on allergy tests. Does this makes sense and should we recommend the same thing when we have a baby with severe eczema?</p><p>4. If a baby has not started solids jet and he/she is dealing with a serious eczema on his face and body what would the best recommendations for starting solids? A mindful introduction of allergenic foods would be enough? At which moment it would be best to start with the elimination diet and the healing protocol?</p><p>Thank you so much for your answer.</p><p>Ana</p>]]></message>

<message><![CDATA[<p>Hello,</p><p>I have finally found a suitable client volunteer for the food sensitivity / eczema trial who has a baby that has recently started solids (6.5 months) and is experiencing tummy discomfort and constipation, as well as mild eczema.</p><p>My client raised an interesting question when filling in the forms, asking if she should she fill in the food journal with her own diet as well as what her baby is eating (only 1 meal a day at this stage). The reason for this question is that the mother suspects that her baby has a dairy and egg sensitivity (not diagnosed), as she has noticed a pattern of reflux symptoms tending to flare up when she eats these foods in her own diet (she is breastfeeding). As she believes that what she is eating may still impacting her daughter through her milk, is this something to address in parallel to the elimination of trigger foods for the gut support protocol in the baby's own diet?</p><p>Also, when eliminating a food (e.g. egg) from baby's diet, should I also recommend that the mother removes this food too as she is still breastfeeding (and because this baby is still very young she is still taking a lot of milk). For context, the client is already cutting down on dairy and eggs, although not completely eliminating, which seems to help the symptoms.</p><p>Thank you, I am really keen to help this mother as she is trying really hard to do all the right things to ease her baby's discomfort. However, it's a slightly complicated case given that the tummy troubles started before she started solids and have since worsened with the introduction of food so any guidance I can get to provide the best advice would be much appreciated :)</p>]]></message>

<message><![CDATA[<p>Hi Rachel ‒ this can be an especially difficult and sensitive topic to navigate with clients. I wish that I could provide a straightforward response that would be applicable to all individuals; however, each client will require unique adaptations based on their personal preferences and overall disposition.</p><p>Generally speaking, I would recommend expanding on what you have learnt in the most neutral way possible. There is no need to convince your client otherwise, but rather share information on the topic of developmental readiness.

<message><![CDATA[<p>Hi Ana, Chantel here! You are absolutely correct in recommending that this client proceed with an allergist. It does sound like this baby may have a dairy allergy, in which case you can support accordingly once a diagnosis has been received. The baby can proceed with the introduction of animal-based proteins as the proteins involved in the allergy are broken down into amino acids by the animal consuming dairy.</p><p>In regards to your third question, we have seen incredible resolutions with the elimination protocol for eczema. Eczema is typically related to food sensitivities which an allergy test would unfortunately not detect. In the case that an elimination protocol for severe eczema does not resolve the issue, it can be beneficial to recommend further allergy testing.</p><p>For a baby experiencing eczema prior to the introduction of solids, we would recommend beginning with low allergenic foods for the first few weeks before going forth with the Gut Support Protocol. It is still recommended to proceed with the introduction of allergenic foods for exposure. However, instead of eliminating high-allergenic sources as outlined in the Gut Support Protocol, the baby will proceed with an introduction of these foods as the parent(s) monitor changes in baby's eczema patches.</p>]]></message>

<message><![CDATA[<p>Hi Cesca,</p><p>Mother’s tend to do everything humanly possible for their sweet babes ‒ especially during times when baby is experiencing noticeable discomfort. Generally speaking, a baby’s direct reaction to food will be enough to gauge whether or not they are sensitive to a particular dietary source(s). Then, when implementing the Gut Support Protocol, it is often enough to allow baby to tolerate these foods from the maternal diet. If a mother is keen to proceed with an elimination protocol, and felt it was not too strenuous during the postpartum period, she can certainly eliminate these foods from her diet. Though, we do tend towards the avoidance of elimination diets at this time unless it is absolutely necessary. The postpartum period can be a particularly stressful time when simple nourishment, without restriction, can be challenging. It is also important to remain mindful that both eggs and dairy contain vital postpartum nutrients that can negatively influence the rate of breastfeeding if not closely monitored.</p><p>‒ Chantel</p>]]></message>

<message><![CDATA[<p>Not a silly question! Vitamin D3 requires fat, but DHA is a fatty acid on its own, so it doesn't require an additional fat for absorption.</p><p>Consuming fat-soluble vitamins in a pressed powder form with a source of fat (eg. coconut oil) would be sufficient. The reason we typically don't recommend this, is because it's unlikely to happen 100% of the time, even with the best of efforts. Therefore, supplementing with these in a liquid/capsule that already has a fat base is more reliable. However, consuming the pressed powder pill with a fat source would certainly work if someone was trying to finish off a bottle they had, for example.</p>]]></message>

<message><![CDATA[<p>Hi there,</p><p>I’m currently 37 weeks pregnant and have been advised by my American midwife to stop taking Omega 3 due to the fact that it can delay the onset of labor. I now have an Icelandic midwife and she does not seem to be concerned. I’ve done some research and have found some that do recommend you stop in the last few weeks of pregnancy. I’m wondering what your thoughts are on this as I did not see it mentioned in the pregnancy nutrition. I did have a client that was in her third trimester and was not sure whether to share this information with her or not. What should we advice our clients on doing?</p>]]></message>

<message><![CDATA[<p>Yes, we suggest carrying on with the protocol by eliminating those foods from the baby's diet directly, reintroducing when appropriate. Although they may be getting some secondary exposure through breast milk, you should definitely be able to tell baby's response through elimination and reintroduction directly through their own diet. Once the gut support is implemented, baby should also hopefully be able to tolerate secondary exposure through breast milk.</p>]]></message>

<message><![CDATA[<p>Hi Nadia, big congrats as you near birth and meeting your baby! What a magical time.</p><p>Omega 3s are widely recognized to delay 'preterm birth' (before 37 weeks), which is absolutely beneficial. As for stopping supplementation once full term, this is a personal decision. Baby's brain continues to develop and grow in the last few weeks of pregnancy, which is supported by omega 3. I would personally rather support that growth than risk post-term. But it depends on how patient your midwife is with post-term pregnancies. An alternative would be replacing omega 3 supplementation (with multiple fatty acids) with a straight DHA only. As it's actually the EPA fatty acid that's responsible for the potential delay of labor.</p><p>You've inspired me to add this to the curriculum — thank you. Wishing you all the best in your final weeks of waiting!</p><p>Carley</p>]]></message>

<message><![CDATA[<p>So I am hoping this question is relevant to this discussion board. A friend of mine was asking my opinion as a parent as to moving up a 'stage' in formulas say from stage one to stage 2 ect. I had formula fed my son due to being unable to breast feed him hence her asking me this question. She wondered whether now her daughter was one should she move her to stage 3 formula or try her on cows milk or a nut milk instead. She works full time and pumping isn't an option for her so her daughter has formula bottles when in care. What is your thoughts on the type of mil she should have at this age?</p>]]></message>

I have my client trial for food sensitivities tomorrow and the baby has a suspected sensitivity to cow's milk, so I will be recommending an elimination diet as part of the healing protocol. However, the baby is having a small amount (210 ml) of formula per day (but is breast fed the rest of the time), so does this need to be eliminated (either via switching to a non cow's milk containing band or fully breastfeeding?). The formula's primary ingredient is "Whey protein hydrolysate (from milk),"</p><p>Thank you!</p>]]></message>

<message><![CDATA[<p>Hi Lucy ‒ thanks for your patience with my reply! When baby’s develop eczema before their introduction to solids, it is often indicative of a need for further gut support and will likely get worse as baby explores additional foods. While this client would not satisfy the requirements for the Food Sensitivities / Eczema client trial, you can certainly proceed with supporting this client’s introduction of solids with emphasis on gut support where applicable.</p><p>‒ Chantel</p>]]></message>

<message><![CDATA[<p>Hey OBA-Team, I just read the part about using "a donut" to sit on if there are stitches and sitting causes discomfort after vaginal delivery. As a midwife and specialized pelvic floor instructor I learned to not recommend them, since they are often making a woman to sit more then she actually should in this time. If she doesn't feel comfortable to sit yet, it should be seen as a sign of her body to rest and lie down instead of sitting. In case she needs to sit for a short period (i.e. eating herself or feeding the baby) it would be better if she just uses a normal soft pillow instead of a "donut", since it is important that the pelvic floor touches the surface so it is not pushed unfavorably far down which would lead to even more discomfort and swelling later on. <br>I just had to add this and maybe you can also add something like this in the curriculum. <br>Thanks!<br>Carole</p>]]></message>

<message><![CDATA[<p>Hi Carole, thank you so much for your insight. I'm so grateful that you shared your perspective with us. Admittedly, I very much included the use of a donut due with a certain level of personal bias. I had a rather significant (and truly uncomfortable) thrombosed hemorrhoid during the end of my last pregnancy and into early postpartum. I was very much unable to sit without my trusty donut. It may have indeed continued to push things unfavorably down further, but I couldn't be in a vehicle without it.</p><p>Although, I do know this is quite different than stitches post birth, so I'm really glad you mentioned something. Just because my donut was a life saver for me, doesn't mean they're the right choice for everyone ;)</p><p>Your feedback is very much appreciated and always welcomed. I'll absolutely add this to the curriculum if you're okay with that. Happy to site you as well!</p>]]></message>

<message><![CDATA[<p>Hi there!</p><p>Re: vitamin D3</p><p>I understand that the vitamin needs to have a shelf stable fat like coconut oil to make sure that the body can properly utilize it. If omega 3 fatty acids are present in the vitamin does this qualify as a sufficient fat for the vitamin d3 to do its job?</p><p> My other question is: there are some canned fish in the food sources of d3 list - are canned fish (assuming it’s wild caught &amp; bpa free) safe/good for regular consumption (I.e. a couple times a week) for Mom’s and babies?

<message><![CDATA[<p>Hi,</p><p>Yesterday I watched the live video call for this module and one of the students asked about whether a tomato is a common allergenic fruit. In the video Carley said tomato is not usually a problem however, I have noticed that both my daughter and niece suffer from a mild red rash when traces of tomato (i.e. passata, canned diced tomatoes or fresh tomatoes) are left around their mouth or on their cheeks until wiped off at the end of their meal. Then it usually takes maybe 15mins or so to clear.</p><p>The following site calls this "Perioral Food Rash" or "Perioral Contact Dermatitis", and explains that is common in babies and toddlers and often happens with citrus fruits, tomatoes and berries (<a href="https://pediaclinic.net/Perioral-Food-Rash)" rel="nofollow noopener" title="https://pediaclinic.net/Perioral-Food-Rash)">https://pediaclinic.net/Per...</a>.</p><p>Is this accurate information we can discuss with our clients?</p>]]></message>

<message><![CDATA[<p>Hi team,</p><p>I just had a couple of more questions for you please.</p><p>First one was around children classified as 'high risk' when it comes to allergies. my client for the trial's first born daughter is allergic to peanuts so she is naturally nervous about testing on her 7 month old daughter. There is nobody else in the family on either the mother or father's side that have an allergy to peanuts, therefore would her 7 month old be considered high risk if it is just get sibling?</p><p>The second question is around the introduction to meats. Do you think there is a certain amount of time you need to wait for a baby to have been having vegetables and fruits before you introduce meats? or is it just if baby is tolerating meat, you can start to gradually introduce?</p><p>Thank you!</p><p>Lucy</p>]]></message>

<message><![CDATA[<p>Hi Rachel. Thanks for your patience with our reply, it was a long weekend here. You are correct, while tomatoes aren't typically an "allergenic" some little ones do experience redness on their face. The link you provided isn't working, however, perioral contact dermatitis is commonly accompanied by more than just redness. It can include a scaly rash that is acne-like with flaking and sometimes small blisters, and is less likely to clear after 15 minutes.</p><p>However, tomatoes also are high in histamine which can trigger redness in sensitive babies. This may be more like what they are describing as a "Perioral Food Rash". It typically only lasts a few minutes and doesn't leave a trace. This is discussed further in module 4.</p>]]></message>

<message><![CDATA[<p>Hi Lucy,</p><p>1. Yes, any direct relative would increase the child's risk factor.</p><p>2. It can be introduced right away. Meat is generally tolerated quite well, so it's more about how it's served (pureed or as a safe finger food) as opposed to waiting a certain amount of time. However, if the family is doing BLW, waiting a little time is recommended so baby can get used to "chewing &amp; swallowing" before meat is introduced, as it's a tougher texture.</p>]]></message>

<message><![CDATA[<p>Hi Bec ‒ the recommendations put forth in the Gestational Diabetes protocol would be particularly supportive for a client with leptin resistance. I’d recommend increased mindfulness around reducing your client’s refined carbohydrate intake in favor of whole, unrefined carbohydrates that are complemented with protein and healthy fats. This will help to stabilize your client’s blood glucose levels. Additionally, it can be beneficial to recommend space for moderate exercise, to her comfort level, and ample sleep. Often when sleep is negatively impacted, there is an increase in the hormone ghrelin, which is responsible for hunger and appetite. Prioritizing sleep can help to reduce ghrelin levels and improve leptin sensitivity / overall satiation.</p><p>‒ Chantel</p>]]></message>

<message><![CDATA[<p>Hi Brittany, Inflammation is a factor. However, it's actually more to do with the fact that those with PCOS should be very mindful of their blood sugar levels. It's common to have insulin resistance when you have PCOS. It's actually believed that insulin resistance may be a root cause of PCOS... and tropical fruit contains higher levels of sugar (fructose) than other fruits.</p>]]></message>

<message><![CDATA[<p>Hi Britany, it would really consider the conditions/symptoms that this client was facing. Soy isn't "bad", but each and every food has it's benefits and potential drawbacks. It's usually all about balance. Although if someone is out of balance, certain foods can help adjust that (bring it back into balance) or push it further out of balance. Tempeh is preferred and can be enjoyed by anyone, including vegans or vegetarians. However, it's better to be more mindful (limit consumption) of all soy for those with hormonal irregularity, estrogen dominance, hypothyroidism, and PCOS.</p>]]></message>

<message><![CDATA[<p>It depends on your client’s symptomatology and the severity of her symptoms. For example, does this client have mild blood glucose imbalance that presents with energetic crashes in the afternoon, or is it gestational diabetes? There are also other factors to consider, such as, are there appropriate substitutions for this food source? Would removing it make this client feel deprived? If a client would like to continue consuming a banana daily it can be tremendously beneficial to ensure that it is balanced with a source of protein and healthy fat (i.e. nut butter and hemp seeds). Often client’s with blood glucose irregularities feel best when limiting their consumption of tropical and dried fruits to two servings per day.</p><p>‒ Chantel</p>]]></message>

<message><![CDATA[<p>Phytoestrogens<br>Whilst soy and tofu has greater amounts of phytoestrogens which should be avoided for hormone inbalance, what would be your view on phytoestrogens in general? In the video's you talk of phytoestrogens blocking the Estrogen receptors but I'm also led to believe that phytoestrogens have benefits for balancing hormones too? Example, my naturopath recently has me drinking red clover tea for example :). is it more to do with the individual food source and/or how its processed?<br>Thank you! Rochelle</p>]]></message>

I have written mine as if I am responding to her directly, I have clearly outlined the areas where I am answering the required questions, but I reread the best practice for assignments and it states to rewrite the question within your response to ensure you don't forget to answer all the questions.

<message><![CDATA[<p>Hi Georgia ‒ excellent questions! One of the fundamental principles that guide Ayurvedic thought and practice are the three doshas. Doshas are understood to be the primary forces behind all physiological and psychological functions. Based on an individual’s dosha, the diet is then adjusted to consume or restrict certain foods.</p><p>While unrefined rice and whole grains offer more nutritional benefits, their dense composition can actually be more difficult for client’s with compromised digestive systems. As such, these client's may feel better consuming refined grains like basmati rice. Basmati rice is also thought to be naturally balanced in all three doshas.</p><p>‒ Chantel</p>]]></message>

For this particular assignment, both response formats are welcomed; however, we do ask that your responses follow the question structure outlined in the assignment instructions. I would also recommend reviewing the lesson entitled ‘Assignment Submission Best Practices’ in the Oh Baby Academy Orientation as this will help to illuminate our expectations around point distribution.

<message><![CDATA[<p>Hi :)</p><p>I have question about organic vs non-organic food. I have found some papers about the differences between them and they concluded that "Despite  the  widespread  perception  that  organically  produced  foods  are  more  nutritious  than  conventional  alternatives,  we  did  not  find  robust  evidence  to  support  this perception" and "In  summary,  our  comprehensive  review  of  the  pub-lished literature on the comparative health outcomes, nu-trition, and safety of organic and conventional foods iden-tified limited evidence for the superiority of organic foods.The evidence does not suggest marked health benefits fromconsuming organic versus conventional foods, although or-ganic  produce  may  reduce  exposure  to  pesticide  residuesand  organic  chicken  and  pork  may  reduce  exposure  toantibiotic-resistant bacteria." ( Smith-Spangler, C. et al. Are organic foods safer or healthier than conventional alternatives? A systematic review. Annals of Internal Medicine 157, 348–366 (2012).) So, are they really that better? Because they price is much higher compared to "regular" food.</p><p>Also, there is recommendation to avoid GMO - why?</p><p>And also, there are some researches about soaking nuts that concluded that "Differences in phytate concentrations between treated and untreated nuts were very small" and "Significantly higher bloating was found after consumption of soaked nuts compared to untreated nuts." So, is soaking the nuts really necessary?</p><p>Thanks,<br>Tea</p>]]></message>

<message><![CDATA[<p>Polyunsaturated fats are not inherently ‘bad’ but rather they are prone to oxidation and are sensitive to heat, light, and oxygen. Oils that contain polyunsaturated fats can be problematic if the oils are oxidized which can often happen during processing. It is also important to note that human beings typically consume higher quantities of omega 6s which leads to an imbalance between omega 6 and omega 3 fatty acids. This overconsumption of oxidized omega 6s can lead to a myriad of modern diseases, inflammatory conditions, high LDL cholesterol, and accelerated aging. While omega 3s are also polyunsaturated, they are less processed when sourced from high-quality supplements and/or food sources. They also contain other beneficial fatty acids, such as DHA and EPA.</p><p>‒ Chantel</p>]]></message>

<message><![CDATA[<p>Hi Tea ‒ we love that you are delving into the academic literature! It is important to note that the philosophy underlying nutrition should never be considered as dogmatic but rather inspire your curiosity in what you know as true.</p><p>You are correct in recognizing that organic food is not necessarily more nutrient-dense than conventional food. The systemic review cited mentions that the risk for contamination with detectable pesticide residues were lower among organic than conventional produce but the differences in risk for exceeding maximum allowed limits were small. The concern with this is that the maximum allowable limits of these chemicals are not safe for human health. This is the main reason why organic food is considered to be ‘ideal’ ‒ less exposure to toxic compounds. With this said, it is better to eat non-organic produce than to forgo vegetables altogether if organic is unattainable or unfeasible for a client and their family. The Mayo Clinic website has an excellent summary on the benefits of organic vs. conventional foods. It can be accessed at: <a href="http://www.mayoclinic.org/healthy-lifestyle/nutrition-and-healthy-eating/in-depth/organic-food/art-20043880#:~:text=Compared%20with%20conventionally%20grown%20produce,airborne%20pesticides%20from%20conventional%20farms" rel="nofollow noopener" title="www.mayoclinic.org/healthy-lifestyle/nutrition-and-healthy-eating/in-depth/organic-food/art-20043880#:~:text=Compared%20with%20conventionally%20grown%20produce,airborne%20pesticides%20from%20conventional%20farms">www.mayoclinic.org/healthy-...</a>.</p><p>In regards to genetically modified organisms, some level of food modification has been present in our society for a great length of time. However, the concern with GMOs is the alarming rate at which they are entering into the market with no long-term studies on the compatibility to human health. Moreover, these products are engineered to withstand herbicides, specifically glyphosate which carries proven long-term risks such as cancer, liver disease, and endocrine disruption. This is an especially relevant consideration for expectant mothers and their children.</p><p>While soaking nuts is not 100% necessary, most people find that soaking or sprouting their nuts eases their digestive system and significantly reduces bloating. Soaked nuts can also be tremendously beneficial for expectant mothers as it can improve micronutrient absorption at a time when nutrient requirements are at an all-time high. It is common for expectant mothers to experience indigestion in later pregnancy as the growing uterus shifts organs and can increase pressure on the digestive system. It can also be experienced in early pregnancy due to certain hormones, such as progesterone and relaxin, that slow the rate of digestion.</p><p>‒ Chantel</p>]]></message>

<message><![CDATA[<p>Hi Stephanie &amp; Jenn. Thanks for your patience with my reply. Great questions about smoke point vs oxidation. You've actually inspired me to add this to the curriculum!</p><p>Smoke points can often cause confusion. The definition of smoke point is the temperature at which a fat/oil begins to burn and smoke. This is also the point where the oil changes to an unpleasant flavor. This is important to chefs who want to cook certain foods quickly at higher temperatures without having an “off” flavor. This makes sense in the culinary world where flavor, not necessarily nutrition, is the primary focus.</p><p>However, smoke point doesn't determine how well an oil can withstand high heat before becoming oxidized. So when considering health, knowing how sensitive a fat is to becoming oxidized should be the primary consideration — not the smoke point.</p><p>We cover fats more deeply in module 2.</p><p>Carley</p>]]></message>

<message><![CDATA[<p>I know that. I have master in molecular biotechnology :)<br>That is why I also know that selection and hybridization is non-specific (we just se phenotype, we don’t know what else is changed inside that plant) and genetical engineering is specific and that GM food must have every thing else same on genotype level (except that one thing we added/changed) <br>I’m not saying that GMO is better than no GMO (we don’t have to have that conversation, everything has its good and bad sides 😉) I’m just saying that “Avoid GMO” is a maybe a bit too harsh without other explanation.</p>]]></message>

<message><![CDATA[<p>With Assignment 1, Module 2, Client 1, We are to list the primary Carbohydrates, fats and Proteins, I am confused with what category some of the foods fall under, maybe I'm just confusing myself, but am I to list Broccoli and onions and the Sauerkraut under the Carbohydrates section? Do all vegetables fall under a category? Or do some not contain any good amounts of Fats, Carbs or Proteins so they cant be listed under any, they just contain Fiber, Vitamins and minerals?</p>]]></message>

<message><![CDATA[<p>Hello!<br>I have a question about my consultation client's baby (15 months old) who is experiencing what seems to be a food sensitivity with pasteurized cheddar cheese. When he eats pasteurized cheddar cheese his cheeks get red for about 30 minutes and then it goes away. He is fine when he consumes pasteurized full fat cow's yogurt, pasteurized cottage cheese, and feta and parmesan. My client now feeds him raw cheddar cheese and he has no issues with that. She has tried a few different brands of pasteurized cheddar cheese and he has the issue every time. Is there something to be aware of with pasteurized cheese that would cause this issue vs. pasteurized yogurt/cottage cheese? I appreciate your thoughts as this issue has stumped me a bit, thanks!</p>]]></message>

<message><![CDATA[<p>Hi Breeanna ‒ the majority of foods contain all three macronutrients in varying proportions. I would recommend reviewing the Oh Baby Food Guide presented in Module 1 of Foundational Nutrition. It is an excellent resource when familiarizing yourself with foods that are considered to be primary sources of carbohydrates, fats, and proteins. There are also additional considerations like fermented foods, non-starchy vegetables, and dark leafy greens that are important components of a balanced diet.</p><p>‒ Chantel</p>]]></message>

<message><![CDATA[<p>Hi Bree ‒ excellent questions! The Price Look-Up codes (PLU) for produce are used on a global scale; however, the system is voluntary and not mandated by any governing body. In regards to recycling codes there are different recycling systems in place around the world. From my understanding, the International Resin Identification Coding System presented in the lesson on supplement quality is the international standard.</p><p>‒ Chantel</p>]]></message>

<message><![CDATA[<p>Your questions are always welcomed, Jaimi!</p><p>Currently there is no scientific correlation between these conditions and gut inflammation, sensitivities, or intolerance. However, these conditions have been increasingly associated with maternal MTHFR gene mutations that negatively influence the conversion of folic acid into methylated folate during pregnancy.</p><p>Cradle cap is an overgrowth of yeast thought to be related to food sensitivity and/or food intolerance. As it is a yeast imbalance, a probiotic containing Saccharomyces Boulardii can be tremendously beneficial. Another suspected cause of cradle cap arises from an underlying biotin deficiency.

<message><![CDATA[<p>Hi Jess!</p><p>1) I believe a mix of cooked and raw are ideal and each offer their own benefits. Whereas soaking grains/nut/seeds to reduce phytic acid serves to increase their nutritional value by reducing phytic acid, cooking greens reduces pytic acid *but also* reduces enzymes, some nutrients etc.</p><p>2) Yes, that is a beneficial source of resistant starch. There are also other foods offering resistant starch that are less refined, but white rice is a popular one. We'll be adding more about this to the curriculum soon due to its current popularity.</p><p>3) It is... thanks for bringing this up, we'll add it in.</p><p>4) As it's predominantly polyunsaturated, it's best to purchase cold-pressed and use for dressing or a drizzle, or very low heat. It does have a high smoke point, but that is for flavor/culinary purposes and not an indicator of oxidization. More on this in module 2.</p><p>5) I really don't think that any sweetener is "perfect." Sweeteners that raise blood sugar certainly impact hormones as well, just in a different way than stevia might. We'll be exploring this more in the upcoming fertility course, but regardless, small doses is definitely best.</p><p>Great questions ;)<br>— Carley</p>]]></message>

<message><![CDATA[<p>I cannot definitively state what the cause is for this particular client; however, I am so happy to hear that this mother was able to identify the cause and make adjustments for her wee babe. It is not uncommon for an individual to react to a specific type of dairy product while happily tolerating other sources. Milk generally tends to be the most reactive source of dairy closely followed by pasteurized cheese. Every cheese undergoes a slightly different process to which a client may react to the process of how it is made and/or the varying level of casein, whey, or lactose in the product.</p><p>‒ Chantel</p>]]></message>

<message><![CDATA[<p>Hello team, just a quick note / question. I have the impression that the content of Omega 3 from Module 2 is quite similar to what was discussed in the Pregnancy module; the needs and benefits, the supplementing notes, etc., are rather relevant info for women who are still pregnant. I would be more interested in what are the omega 3 benefits specifically for postpartum, if the daily requirements differ between early postpartum / later on / breastfeeding / non-breastfeeding, etc. Also if there is any specific requirement for EPA. Thank you!</p>]]></message>

<message><![CDATA[<p>I would recommend proceeding with the infant probiotics from Seeking Health if this client is experiencing gastrointestinal challenges. In the case that this client’s primary health concern is cradle cap, then I would recommend going forth with the Saccharomyces Boulardii probiotic. It is best to recommend a singular probiotic supplement based on this client’s primary health concern. An excellent alternative to this would be Seeking Health’s infant probiotic supplement complemented with the external application of squalane oil for cradle crap.

Instead, we recommend utilizing word like ‘support’, ‘help’, or ‘recommend’.</p><p>‒ Chantel</p>]]></message>

<message><![CDATA[<p>Hi, could I please get some clarification around the preparation/conduction the client trial. I hope it makes sense! I just want to make sure I have interpreted the task correctly.</p><p>Preparation - After reviewing the intake forms and 3 day journal we have been asked to provide a list of 8-12 questions. Once we have discussed these questions are we then required to go back and make further written recommendations or do we continue with the ones we prepared for the consultation and expand on these verbally?</p><p>Is there a template you would like us to follow when writing the consultation information for the client? I would still like this to look professional so any advice would be great.</p><p>I understand that a wordcount is not necessary for this assessment. However, are you able to provide a rough average/estimate in pages to get an idea?<br>Also, in the written task for assessment purposes we have been asked to create an updated 3 day food plan utilizing the changes we have discussed above. It does not ask us to provide this to the client. However, I feel like this could also be beneficial?</p><p>My client has eaten out for at least one meal a day. E.g fish and chips for dinner. How would you recommend I provide substitutes/changes? E.g make a similar meal from home with small changes or healthier options to go with the take out?</p><p>Sorry for the novel!! Thank you for your help :)</p><p>Katie</p>]]></message>

<message><![CDATA[<p>Hi Amanda ‒ thanks for your patience with my reply! I would recommend preparing to discuss both options in consultation with your client. In the case that she communicates a desire to change her prenatal multivitamin, without continuing forth with her previous supplement, then you may proceed with a nutrient analysis based on your recommended prenatal multivitamin. If your client is wishing to continue and/or finish the course of her current prenatal multivitamin, then the nutrient recommendations should include both.</p><p>‒ Chantel</p>]]></message>

<message><![CDATA[<p>Hi there, my client is trying to conceive (and still breastfeeding) and is wanting best advice for these considerations. She has an amazing diet (almost OBA textbook!), she is on some great supplements for breastfeeding and general health. Are there any specific points I should be covering for her specific needs? In addition to what I would recommend for any female. I am currently thinking providing an emphasis on hydration, healthy fats, balanced nutrient dense meals, rainbow of veg for maximal vitamins and antioxidants and food quality. Just wanted to see if there was any other specific advice I could offer her to maximise the consult one as a learning experience for me and two for her.</p><p>Thanks so much!</p>]]></message>

<message><![CDATA[<p>You are correct in recognizing that collagen lacks an essential amino acid, tryptophan, and is therefore categorized as an incomplete protein. However, tryptophan is present in many dietary sources which helps to complement the amino acid profile of collagen. As collagen is nearly tasteless, it tends to be a more versatile recommendation than whole food bone broth protein powders. With that said, both are fantastic options depending on your client’s dietary rhythms and preferences.</p><p>‒ Chantel</p>]]></message>

<message><![CDATA[<p>Hi Lily ‒ this falls into the category of fertility which is ultimately outside the scope of practice for the Foundational Nutrition course. The OBA team is in the midst of developing a Fertility course; however, during the interim I would recommend continuing forth with her nutrient-dense rhythms and emphasizing the nutrients that breastfeeding may deplete as outlined in the curriculum. The Healthy Habits section will be particularly helpful for this.</p><p>‒ Chantel</p>]]></message>

<message><![CDATA[<p>Hi Katie ‒ thanks for your patience with my reply! In preparation for your consultation, I would recommend outlining an appropriate nutrition plan based on your thoughtful questions and suggestions. These recommendations should take into consideration the foods that you recommend including, reducing, and finding healthy alternatives for, along with your menu plan and lifestyle recommendations. Some students prefer to integrate their recommended food journal in conversation, while others may consider additional graphics (i.e. concrete copy or shared screen through Zoom pending on the mode of consultation).</p><p>Often clients will reveal more information during the consultation, so it is important to honour your client’s individuality and be flexible with your previously prepared recommendations. In regards to your client’s takeout patterns, I would be curious what motivates this frequency and explore the impact these meals have on her health. Beginning with small, impactful recommendations can be tremendously beneficial for lasting change. If your client is open to exploring time-conscious alternatives for takeout meals, this would also be an excellent consideration.</p><p>These consultation notes are solely for your own personal organization. However, we do ask that your written submission follow the structure outlined in the lesson entitled ‘Writing your Client Trial’. You may find this lesson helpful when structuring your preparation notes too. Generally speaking, a well written client trial spans approximately10-pages in length.</p><p>‒ Chantel</p>]]></message>

<message><![CDATA[<p>Hello,</p><p>I am just in the middle of writing up my client trial and just needed some advice. My client's baby has a food sensitivity or possible allergy to dairy. She has been through the process of elimination before as her eldest daughter is allergic to dairy. When I conducted her consultation, we didn't touch much on the process of elimination, because she had already picked up on a reaction from dairy when baby was 4 weeks old, she has kept it out of his diet ever since. She also already knows the process as she went through it with her daughter.</p><p>When it comes to doing my write up I feel like I may not be hitting the specific marks for the Identification and food substitute section. As the client has completely cut out all dairy already.<br>We did talk about reintroducing foods back into the diet. I am just worried I may lose some marks off my assignment.</p><p>Thank you</p>]]></message>

<message><![CDATA[<p>Hi Team,</p><p>I am just setting up a potential client for foundational nutrition and she mentioned she has eczema that flares up often.

<message><![CDATA[<p>Hi Jacqui, congrats on taking this program on while working full time. I know the commitment this takes, but it's impressive that you are making time for something you're feel so passionate about. To answer your question, yes... any deliverables have to be submitted by the course deadline, not during the week they are released. While we encourage students to stay somewhere within the module release dates when possible, we know that everyone has other commitments. That's exactly why we padded an additional 50% on to the timeline. Life happens! Thanks for reaching out to clarify this.<br>— Carley</p>]]></message>

<message><![CDATA[<p>Hi Jacqui ‒ sincerest apologies for the delay in my reply!</p><p>This can be a tricky answer to navigate as active vitamin A is typically sourced from animals (i.e. fish liver) or in its synthetic form (i.e. retinyl palmitate or retinyl acetate). The ester forms of retinol should ideally be avoided during pregnancy; however, there are certain circumstances, such as strictly plant-based mothers, who may require synthetic vitamin A with increased mindfulness around remaining under the upper tolerable intake limit set at 3000mcg RAE or 10,000IU.</p><p>‒ Chantel</p>]]></message>

<message><![CDATA[<p>Hi Breeanna, apologies for the delayed reply. There is some level of crossover between a candida diet and diet recommendations for a UTI. However, there are also some differences. Both include dietary recommendations to reduce/eliminate sugar, fruit juices (other than unsweetened, nothing added, 100% cranberry juice), and refined “white” carbohydrates. UTIs are caused by bacteria, whereas candida is a yeast that yeast that is also impacted by things such as vinegar and grapes or most mushrooms. As for a health professional to seek help from, a CNC is qualified to support with UTIs. The recommendations are in the UTI protocol are very effective, particularly the D-mannose. However, clients should see a doctor is there is any lower back pain, new symptoms, or worsening of existing symptoms, which may indicate that the infection has reached their kidneys.</p>]]></message>

She is 5.5 months postpartum and still experiences pain on her c-section scar and her belly button. I have yet to see if she has spoken to her health care provider about this to rule out adhesions or potential complications but would like to offer some support here if possible.

<message><![CDATA[<p>Hi Soukaina. Although this can be common, if she is still experiencing pain at this stage, it would be best to refer her to her her primary health care provider. While we can offer recommendations to support the skin and healing, these are best made in the early days postpartum. Massaging the scar (also called scar mobilization) can be very helpful to break up tight scar tissue, however, we would want her care provider just to rule out other complications before trying this approach.</p><p>To help her articulate the sensation you can ask her if any of these describe what she is feeling:<br>— Reduced skin mobility<br>— Pain or increased sensitivity in the skin around the scar<br>— Nerve irritation in the scar tissue<br>— A tugging or pulling  feeling around the scar<br>— Increased tension in the muscles around the scar</p><p>All the best with your client trial.</p>]]></message>

<message><![CDATA[<p>Hi Lou ‒ we would recommend a mindful re-introduction of egg yolk while supporting baby’s intestinal and immune systems. In Module 4 of Baby Nutrition, we delve into the topics of an elimination diet, building and diversifying beneficial bacteria in the microbiome, strengthening the intestinal barrier, and optimizing nutrient absorption. We have seen incredible resolutions of food sensitivities (and eczema) while implementing the Gut Support Protocol. If the constipation does not resolve in tandem with the food sensitivity, it may require further support as we will soon discuss in Module 5.</p><p>‒ Chantel</p>]]></message>

<message><![CDATA[<p>Hi Chantel,</p><p>Thank you for your reply. I assumed this list was for symptoms of 'allergic' reactions. Am I right in assuming that all the mild/delayed symptoms of an allergenic reaction are also what we would then refer to as symptoms of a sensitivity? How do we then distinguish between a mild allergy and a sensitivity? I'm still not seeing the clear distinction here. Sorry if I'm being slow!!</p>]]></message>

<message><![CDATA[<p>We are more than happy to provide further clarification. Symptoms of a non-severe food allergy can be similar to those of a food sensitivity; however, the distinction comes from the timing of the reaction rather than the symptoms themselves. If baby is experiencing nasal symptoms within 2-hours of consumption, for example, it would align with a non-severe food allergy. In contrast, if these nasal symptoms occurred between a few hours up to 3-days following consumption, this would be indicative of a food sensitivity.</p><p>‒ Chantel</p>]]></message>

<message><![CDATA[<p>Hi Maria – with the exception of your client's answers, your client trial submission should be written in past tense form. This ultimately needs to be reflective of what you shared with your client during consultation, rather than what you plan to share as this can and should change based on what resonates with your client. In addition to nutrient-dense, balanced meals I would recommend increased mindfulness around the categories that influence blood glucose levels. The OBA Food Guide is a tremendous resource when considering which categories may influence your client's unique symptomatology. Furthermore, we typically delve into this topic during Pregnancy Nutrition; however, your client may find the addition of cinnamon helpful as it will assist in balancing blood sugar.</p><p>– Chantel</p>]]></message>

<message><![CDATA[<p>My 5 weeks postpartum client is feeling exhausted. She is now a mum of 3 and when going through my questions in our client trial, I asked about sleep. Her response was that she goes to bed around 10pm after her son's first night feed and her 5yr old has gone to bed around 9/9.30. Clearly she needs to go to bed earlier, but her daughter going to bed so late is preventing her from doing this. I didn't feel comfortable trying to tell her how to manage her children's bedtimes (it seemed so obvious to me to put her to bed at 7pm) and I am not a sleep expert, so what would you suggest in this circumstance? I kind of felt stuck in a rock and  a hard place with advice on how to help improve sleep, which would dramatically improve how she is feeling.</p>]]></message>

<message><![CDATA[<p>Hi team,  <br>One of the areas of concern ion my clients intake form is “adrenals not great" and she is taking supplement Ad Health as prescribed by her doc. Whilst she doesn't go into any detail, she has reported high stress levels. I thought about providing recommendations restricting the main hormonal affecting foods, low sugar, mindful eating and overall better balance. I also understand, not from this course but an increase in healthy fat is generally overall supportive for adrenals. Am I on the right path, anything to add or should I not go there since it could be out of scope?</p>]]></message>

<message><![CDATA[<p>This can be a sensitive subject to navigate as schedule changes often feel insurmountable ‒ especially for a sleep deprived mama. I would recommend first sympathizing with this client and then gently exploring approaches that other mother’s have found beneficial (i.e. beginning an incremental bedtime routine change, dimming the house lights, etc). Once these recommendations have been made, it is important to check-in with their applicability to your client's daily life. For example, “Do any of these recommendations resonate with you?” and/or “What are some potential challenges you might face implementing these?”. This will help you determine whether your client is likely to follow through on your thoughtful suggestions, or if you would be better off providing an alternative. Another impactful question to ask is, “Do you have anyone to support these transitions?”. Perhaps her partner or family member could take care of their oldest daughter’s bedtime routine while mama creates space for an earlier bedtime.</p><p>‒ Chantel</p>]]></message>

<message><![CDATA[<p>Hi Olivie ‒ many supplements carry the warning 'not to be used during pregnancy' because they are strongly contraindicated during this development stage. These labels may also carry the warning not because there is evidence of harm, but rather a lack of supporting data and clinical testing due to ethical reasons. As sufficient research can not be conducted to verify potential risks or benefits of certain supplements, many manufacturers take a conservative approach. Because of this, even supplements that are generally considered safe and beneficial during pregnancy can carry this warning on their labels. Unless you are absolutely certain of a supplement’s safety profile, including its ingredients and dosage, it is recommended that your client consult with their primary healthcare provider to reduce the likelihood of litigation in the case that the supplement proves harmful.</p><p>‒ Chantel</p>]]></message>

<message><![CDATA[<p>Re: raw fish and parasites</p><p>If flash freezing is what destroys the parasites that make fish consumption a fear during pregnancy, is it a myth that "fresh" fish as in just caught, never frozen, raw fish is safest during pregnancy?</p><p>I am particularly curious as a lot of famous and reputable Asian sushi/sashimi restaurants market their fish as fresh and therefore best by showing the fish you are about to be served alive in a tank as you walk in. Yes, they're "fresh" and wild caught, but is correct to conclude that because they were never flash frozen they contain parasites that are alive and well thereby not recommended during pregnancy?</p><p>And on the note of parasites, parasite cleanses seem to be gaining a lot of popularity these days - from my understanding, everyone has parasites. Is it not recommended for pregnant and breastfeeding women to partake in these cleanses? If so, why not? It seems very enticing and good to get rid of the parasites!</p><p>Thank you!</p>]]></message>

<message><![CDATA[<p>I have a question around the wholegrain flours. Are the gluten-free wholegrain flours (buckwheat, millet, quinoa, rice etc) included in the carbohydrates to consider category because they have been milled to a flour and are therefore refined? Or is there another reason? Also wondering if they've been put in this category because they haven't been through the activation process?</p>]]></message>

<message><![CDATA[<p>Hi I am curious about your thoughts on Klaire Labs prenatal. When comparing to the MegaFood Baby &amp; Me Klaire has higher mcg for a few different minierals/vitamins. The "other ingredients" are fairly similar to each other as well. I have always found that food based prenatals can never reach the potency of synthetic, but I would really love to know your thoughts on this. Is it because the food based supplements are more bioavailable? Thank you!</p>]]></message>

<message><![CDATA[<p>There are so many contrasting opinions on the subject! Carley previously worked in supplement manufacturing and each manufacturer truly has a different viewpoint on the optimal timing of probiotic supplementation. Some believe that an empty stomach is best so that the probiotic capsule moves through the acidic environment of the stomach as quickly as possible. Others believe that it is best to consume alongside food so that the prebiotic content can act as a food source for the probiotics in the digestive tract. We ultimately believe that consistency is the best approach with clients!</p>]]></message>

<message><![CDATA[<p>That is correct ‒ flash frozen is a safer option for expectant mothers as almost 70% of parasites remain invisible to the human eye. The risk of parasites can also improve when fresh fish is thoroughly cooked prior to consumption. If consuming these sources raw, it is best to ensure that the fish is purchased from a reputable restaurant, consumed directly after purchasing, and higher-risk species (i.e. cod and whitefish) avoided if not flash frozen or thoroughly cooked. These precautions will help to reduce the likelihood of parasitic infections that become more complicated for healthcare practitioners to treat during pregnancy. With this said, it is important to remain mindful of the many health benefits high-quality fish offers to expectant mothers and empower their understanding of best practices if choosing to consume.</p><p>Most human beings have parasites to some degree; however, these cleanses should absolutely be avoided during pregnancy due to the contraindications of many herbal ingredients. This type of cleanse would be most impactful for a woman preparing to conceive.</p>]]></message>

<message><![CDATA[<p>No apologies necessary ‒ we want you to feel confident in your knowledge and are always happy to address your questions! Isoflavones are a class of phytoestrogens that have a similar chemical structure to human estrogen, albeit to a weaker extent. These isoflavones can bind to estrogen receptors in the body and cause either a weak estrogenic or anti-estrogenic effect. The extent to which soy isoflavones exert these effects is currently the focus of considerable scientific research and depends on the existing levels of hormones in the human body. We delve into the conditions that are important to remain mindful of in the lesson entitled ‘Oh Baby Food Guide’. These conditions include hormonal irregularity, estrogen dominance, hypothyroidism, and polycystic ovary syndrome. In regards to your question on fermented soy products, the fermentation process is thought to digest soy and promote the body’s ability to absorb isoflavones.</p>]]></message>

<message><![CDATA[<p>The comfortability of including microgreens can vary between parents. Generally speaking, microgreens are thought to be safer for consumption as their potential for bacterial growth is lesser than sprouts. The risk will increase with storage time and be partly dependent on the type of microgreens ‒ some are more susceptible than others. Similarly to dark leafy greens, microgreens can be an occasional addition to help develop baby’s palate for this nutrient-dense source. Its texture is quite stringy so a toothless baby, or one that has not mastered chewing thoroughly, may have a difficult time manipulating these foods which can increase the likelihood of gagging. When purchasing microgreens or sprouts from the grocer, it is important to ensure that they come from a reputable supplier and are as fresh as possible ‒ being mindful of the sell-by-date. If client’s would like to grow these at home, we would recommend special attention towards the quality of seeds purchased and the growing mediums used (i.e. free from harmful bacteria).</p>]]></message>

<message><![CDATA[<p>Hi Olivie ‒ these are excellent questions! Choline is not a widely recognized nutrient, and as such, there have not been any comparative studies to our knowledge. Pasture-raised chickens roam freely in their natural environment, consuming a diet rich in grass and insects. These chickens have been found to contain three to four more times the amount of vitamin D3 than conventional chickens kept indoors. Conventional chickens are typically fed a grain-based diet and are often supplemented with synthetic nutrients. Their close living arrangements and susceptibility to infection also increase the risks of hormonal and/or antibiotic intervention. While pasture-raised eggs are ideal, organic eggs offer a higher nutrient profile in comparison to conventional eggs. These chickens are permitted access outside for part of the day and are fed at least an 80% organic diet. In summary, chickens living in alignment with their natural environment, observing normal behaviours (i.e. playing tag, rooting for worms and seeds), and natural dietary rhythms tend to boast a higher nutritional profile than conventional birds undergoing low-grade chronic stress from their environment and diet</p>]]></message>

<message><![CDATA[<p>1) Is there an upper tolerable limit for vitamin A for babies? In the course material, it states to give a baby no more than 1/4 capsule of desiccated liver and not every day. I looked up the Ancestral Supplements liver pills on Cronometer and it shows that 2 capsules contain 1699.67 IU of vitamin A, so 1/4 capsule would be about 212.5 IU. They also show that a tsp of beef liver (not specified if cooked or raw) contains 2098.57 IU of vitamin A.</p><p>Just trying to figure out how to go about recommending liver to clients in a practical way.</p><p>2) Any idea how much DHA is in grass-fed beef? I've tried to research it but am not having any luck.</p><p>3) Is bee pollen safe for babies, or is there risk for botulism just as there is with honey?</p>]]></message>

<message><![CDATA[<p>Hello, I have one friend and one woman for my client trial who are both exclusively breast feeding and their bleeding stopped at about 5/6 weeks then within a few days they got what they think is their period with cramping and fresh blood. Is this something you have seen before or could it be something else? I advised them both to talk to their GP as I hadn't heard of a period starting that early if exclusively breast feeding. I was just curious on your take.<br>Thanks so much :)</p>]]></message>

<message><![CDATA[<p>Hi there, my client who is 35 years old (is due in 2 weeks) has haemochromotosis, but during later pregnancy her iron has been low so has been taking an iron supplement. Obviously it would depend on how her iron levels are after birth as to how long she continues taking the supplement postpartum for and i know this is out of our scope but do you know what kind of affect haemochromotosis would have on the baby? If normally she avoids iron rich foods..</p><p>Do I discuss with her ways to decrease the absorption of iron?<br>I also read you should avoid foods rich in vitamins A and C if you have haemochromotosis! I don't want baby to be missing out on these nutrients!?</p><p>She also has hyperthyroidism. Would I not recommend any iodine rich foods?</p><p>Much appreciated!</p>]]></message>

<message><![CDATA[<p>Some supplement companies will include the recommended dosage for certain demographics directly on their webpage. For a 6-month-old between 11- and 20-pounds, we would generally recommend 2-drops daily to compliment baby’s nutritional requirements. <a href="https://www.nordicnaturals.com/consumers/babys-dha" rel="nofollow noopener" title="https://www.nordicnaturals.com/consumers/babys-dha">Nordic Naturals Baby DHA</a> is also an excellent, high-quality option based on baby’s weight. The upper tolerable limit for vitamin D is set at 1000 IU between the ages of 0 to 6-months and 1500 IU between 7 and 12-months. Vitamin A, in addition, is established at 600mcg between the ages of 0 to 12-months. There is no established limit set for DHA, however, 605mg would not be too high as long as supplementation, formula, and dietary sources are considered.</p>]]></message>

<message><![CDATA[<p>Hi Jorgia ‒ thanks for your patience with my reply! The return of a mother’s menstrual cycle can vary considerably and be influenced by certain practices like pattern of breastfeeding, extended periods of sleep, co-sleeping, baby wearing, and so forth. It is possible for postpartum mothers to begin menstruating at this time, albeit less common when exclusively breastfeeding. Another possibility would be an increase in lochia due to additional physical activity. A referral to their respective healthcare practitioners can be particularly supportive if your client's are concerned. It is not uncommon for the menstrual flow to be inconsistent at this time and often their next period will be the best way to tell.</p>]]></message>

<message><![CDATA[<p>Hi Ainslee ‒ thanks for your patience with my reply! I am curious if your client has received nutritional guidance from her primary healthcare provider or dietician and if her iron levels are routinely monitored? As the fetal demands for iron increase significantly in the third trimester, I would be mindful of recommending strategies to decrease iron absorption with her current low iron status. However, this information would certainly be beneficial when and if this client experiences iron overload again. In regards to beta-carotene sources, their nutritional benefits are typically thought to outweigh the potential risks, though it is recommended to avoid or significantly reduce consumption of vitamin C-rich foods due to their enhancement of iron absorption when hemochromatosis is a concern.</p><p>It is typically recommended for client's with hyperthyroidism to avoid iodine-rich foods and prioritize goitrogenic foods like cauliflower, Brussel sprouts, and so forth. Goitrogens are naturally occurring substances that block the absorption and utilization of iodine. These food sources should ideally be consumed raw as heat destroys their goitrogenic effect. As these conditions ultimately fall outside your scope of practice, it is important to recommend that your client consult with her primary healthcare practitioner prior to implementation of your thoughtful recommendations. A dietary protocol for hemochromatosis and low iron during pregnancy should be based on frequent monitoring with her primary healthcare practitioner. In early postpartum, iron requirements remain high due to lochia and then begin to drop until menstruation begins. Whether this client continues with additional iron supplementation would require frequent monitoring as you mentioned. More research is ultimately needed to determine the impact of hemochromatosis on pregnancy, however there are no known risk factors that we are currently aware of. Maternal hemochromatosis also does not increase an infant's risk of neonatal hemochromatosis.</p>]]></message>

<message><![CDATA[<p>Hi Theresa, apologies for the delay in our reply! We were just notified of your post and are looking further into the matter.</p><p>That is correct ‒ the Tolerable Upper Limit Intake for vitamin A is established at 600 mcg RAE between the ages of 0 to 12-months. In regards to the whole food source of liver, we typically recommend a few baby-size spoonful's once or twice per week. The type of liver will also influence the amount of active vitamin A that baby is consuming. For example, a quarter-ounce of beef liver contains approximately 548 mcg RAE while the same quantity of chicken liver warrants approximately 282 mcg RAE.</p><p>The omega 3 fatty-acid content of grass-fed beef varies widely due to the type of forage consumed. Some studies have shown up to 3.5-grams of omega 3s per 4-ounces of grass-fed beef while others have measured 1-gram. Of that, the EPA content measured between 20 to 720 mg and 10 to 120 mg of DHA.</p><p>Currently there is limited research on the impact of bee pollen for babies. Studies on the existence of C. botulinum in pollen are almost absent in the medical literature; however, there is one study that detected C. botulinum in other products derived from bees. It is generally recommended to delay honey and other bee-derived products until 12-months of age as a precautionary measure. There is also a concern for baby's with a known or suspected allergy to pollen.</p>]]></message>

<message><![CDATA[<p>Hi Jess ‒ the global promotion and purchase of US-based infant formula and commercial baby food certainly extends beyond its borders. However, it is important to recognize that the legislation will differ pending on the origin of production and the country’s respective regulatory body. This complexifies the worldwide application of the Healthy Babies Bright Futures Report. Having said this, we have seen reports that illuminated high concentrations of heavy metals in European-based baby products.</p>]]></message>

There is limited research on the clinical outcomes of supplemental glutamine for young children with gastrointestinal imbalances. Our preference would be towards glutamine-rich foods like sauerkraut, high quality animal-based proteins, and organ meats. If the family is following a plant-based lifestyle, it can be helpful to recommend other glutamine-rich food sources like cabbage, beets, spinach, and properly prepared pseudo-grains or beans.</p>]]></message>

<message><![CDATA[<p>Hi Carley - A mom in an online mom's group I am in mentioned she is transitioning her 1 year old from formula to cow's milk. Since the introduction of cow's milk, she's been having "blow outs" and irritation from the stool. She doesn't believe it's the cow's milk as her child consumes formula, cheese and yogurt without noticeable issues. I mentioned cow's milk is amongst the top allergenic/irritant foods, that some can have a reaction to cow's milk specifically even though other dairy products are consumed and that there is research to support a diet that is rich in calcium-rich foods, vitamin D-rich foods and good fats can meet a child's nutritional needs without milk. I provided the article included in the module and another I found (although it is not so cut and dry). How do you approach this? Are there other articles and research that you reference that I can pass along? I know that this concept can be very difficult for some to accept but now I feel like my credibility is being challenged here so I just want to make sure I am providing as much relevant info and up to date research as possible. Thank you!</p>]]></message>

<message><![CDATA[<p>I would recommend gently approaching the subject ‒ stating something along the lines of, “I am presently studying to become a Certified Nutrition Consultant and we are learning a lot about food sensitivities in our baby nutrition course. The information is absolutely fascinating and I would be happy to share more if you are interested. I know this can be a difficult topic to navigate with such an abundance of information available online”. The most relevant research on the topic is included in the curriculum; however, it is possible that this baby is reacting to specific proteins in cow’s milk. The proteins in cow’s milk formula have been chemically altered to resemble breast milk and improve its digestive capacities. This is ultimately the mechanism behind why a baby can flourish on cow’s milk formula, but react once introduced to products like whole or 2% milk. It is also possible that the lower lactose content in fermented dairy products and certain cheeses is playing a role in this baby’s experience with dairy.</p>]]></message>

<message><![CDATA[<p>Hi Bree ‒ both iron glycinate and iron bisglycinate are amino acid chelates with high rates of absorption. The difference lies within their chemical structure; iron glycinate is formed from the chelation between ferrous iron and one molecule of the amino acid glycine, while iron bisglycinate reacts with two glycine molecules. Most amino acid mineral chelates have an effective rate of absorption.</p>]]></message>

<message><![CDATA[<p>DHA requirements have not been established for these age groups and can be difficult to estimate from dietary sources, breast milk, and/or formula. The adequate intake of omega 3s, more generally, are established at 0.5g from birth to 12-months and 0.7g from 1 to 3-years. It would be advantageous to offer a minimum of three servings of DHA-rich foods per week, along with additional supplementation due to the importance of DHA in brain development and cognitive function. Typically high-quality supplement companies, like <a href="https://www.nordicnaturals.com/consumers/babys-dha#tab-suggested-use" rel="nofollow noopener" title="https://www.nordicnaturals.com/consumers/babys-dha#tab-suggested-use">Nordic Naturals</a>, will base their recommended dosage on weight rather than age.</p>]]></message>

<message><![CDATA[<p>This answer requires a multifaceted approach as much of the academic literature focuses on specific nutrients, differences between feeding preferences, and the impact of nutrient-depleted diets. One of the most gut-wrenching statistics that we have available is from the <a href="www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/infant-and-young-child-feeding" rel="nofollow noopener" title="www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/infant-and-young-child-feeding">World Health Organization</a> which states that “approximately 45% of deaths among children are linked to undernutrition”. It is the cumulative impact, in which we have endeavored to include in our curriculum, that contributes to the importance of nutrient-dense foods.</p>]]></message>

<message><![CDATA[<p>Thanks Chantel, so would you say bloods are required first to gauge Vitamin A levels before you would think about recommending a synethic supplement to a plant based pregnant client? <br>I assume blood testing would be required before you offered any supplementation to any client? I only ask becuase It seems that the majority of required nutrients for pregnancy you can only get from animal products so would it be correct in saying that you would always recommend to plant Based / vegan mothers supplements for Vitamin B12, Choline, Iodine? (in additional to mandatory Folate and only if prenatal vitamin has low levels) Or only if bloods are showing depletion?</p>]]></message>

<message><![CDATA[<p>You are most welcome! It would be ideal to base your supplement recommendations on known nutrient deficiencies. However, we do typically recommend additional B12 supplementation for all plant-based mothers. In regards to the nutrients choline and iodine, it can be helpful to review your client's food journal to determine if they would benefit from additional supplementation, above and beyond their multivitamin. You may also recommend that your client consult with their healthcare practitioner prior to implementation. As nutrition is so individualized, each plant-based or vegan mother will require slightly different levels of support. If a mother is not open or comfortable supplementing with active vitamin A, it can be advantageous to emphasize beta-carotene-rich foods as it is a water-soluble nutrient that does not pose risk of toxicity in the body, albeit less potent than active vitamin A.</p>]]></message>

<message><![CDATA[<p>Hi Tea ‒ excellent question! Ultimately more research is needed to provide a definitive answer. However, generally speaking acupuncture is safe and can be effective for morning sickness in early pregnancy. Different acupuncture points are stimulated in an effort to produce different results. Therefore, stimulating points for morning sickness should not induce or promote contractions when performed by a skilled acupuncturist.</p>]]></message>

<message><![CDATA[<p>Hi there, I have a question about single food elimination diets. If only one food is removed and tested at a time for a family to not feel as restricted while identifying trigger foods, but there are other suspected trigger foods to be considered, wouldnt consumption of those potential trigger foods while testing another interfere with observation? Meaning, if Im testing for dairy and dont remove wheat during the process, how do I know that wheat is not misleading my observation by causing a reaction? Make sense?</p>]]></message>

<message><![CDATA[<p>Hi Luz ‒ excellent question! Once a trigger source has been eliminated and the client is implementing recommendations from the Gut Support Protocol, their body will be in a more supported state to process stressors and resolve symptoms more efficiently. If the elimination and secondary re-introduction of a single food item does not resolve a client’s symptomatology, it is likely that another trigger source is activating the immune response at which point another item, like wheat, can be eliminated in tandem with dairy and continued gut support. For parents who have not observed an obvious pattern of food sensitivities, it can be helpful to eliminate individual food sources while monitoring for improvement and/or aggravation of symptoms. In the case that a client has observed two highly suspected food triggers, it may be more beneficial to eliminate both food sources simultaneously. This will ultimately depend on the client’s preferences.</p>]]></message>

Her pediatrician advised she use saline to keep her face clean. Obviously she is very worried as even water is irritating her skin. Do you have experience or any recommendation with this? I went through the gut and eczema support protocol with her, but if there's anything else with this specific case you'd recommend, I'd be so grateful to hear. She is also nervous to use any products with coconut derived ingredients and lanolin as she suspects these have intensified her eczema in the past. Thank you!</p>]]></message>

<message><![CDATA[<p>Hi Sara ‒ we have included our eczema-related recommendations in Module 4 of the curriculum and do not have additional strategies beyond what has been shared. If mum is apprehensive of using coconut products and/or lanolin, it can be helpful to explore additional options like shea butter or jojoba oil while sympathizing with her experiences. The best cream for baby is ultimately the one that helps to moisturize their skin without contributing additional irritation (and/or stress on the mother). These are the only measures to support eczema topically while addressing the root imbalances internally. This is where the focus needs to be concentrated, particularly if baby was administered antibiotics for the staph infection. It may be helpful to follow-up with mum to see if her previous experience was with pharmaceutical-grade lanolin. Obviously if there are known or suspected wool allergies, lanolin should be avoided entirely.</p>]]></message>

<message><![CDATA[<p>It would be ideal for this formula to not contain trace elements during an elimination process. However, there are a few paths that we can explore. Firstly, you can recommend an additional probiotic during the elimination process while supporting this client with reducing their overall toxic load. Secondly, you may emphasize the diversity of fermented foods during the elimination process and revisit this supplement at a later time. Lastly, you can recommend that your client proceed with caution while going forth with this probiotic. It is difficult to say with absolute certainly whether or not the trace elements will impact her baby. Having said this, as your client’s overall toxic load reduces, it will be in a better position to process triggers and clear symptoms more efficiently.</p>]]></message>

<message><![CDATA[<p>Hi Erin ‒ we absolutely love ‘The Mothers Blend’ and certainly sympathize with the difficulty in assessing its full nutrient spectrum. This supplement would be well suited for a postpartum mother that follows a relatively nutrient-dense diet and is merely needing a nutritional boost as the exact quantities are unknown. I would recommend mindfulness on the ingredients / nutrients contained in the multivitamin and explore possible nutritional gaps. It may also be advantageous to contact Sheridan directly to see if Foraged For You can offer additional support in this regard.</p>]]></message>

In Croatia even frenulotomy is rare (only a handful of practitioners can do the procedure), and there are no other options and very little information on the topic. I am lactation consultant and I encounter this problem more often than one might think, but there simply aren't enough resources and I am sure a number of women cut their breastfeeding journey short due to this. Any and all information on the topic is welcome. Thank you!</p>]]></message>

I think many woman can benefit from D-Mer being recognized and support being shown in that sense. Also it would be great to know more about supporting a woman who is breastfeeding throughout pregnancy and later tandem feeding. Thank you for your time!</p>]]></message>

For example, Melrose high strength fish oil equates to over 4g of combined DHA/ELA - Is this considered too much for most clients?</p><p>I know from module one that consuming oily fish 3 times weekly will provide adequate nutrients and based on this theory, am I right in assuming during postpartum, consumption of oily fish once a day is not out of the question?

<message><![CDATA[<p>Hi Ela ‒ if a client’s blood panel illuminates lower levels of iron and copper, it would be advantageous to include more copper-rich food sources like organic and grass-fed beef liver, cooked oysters, oats, sesame seeds, cashews, and so forth. While copper is certainly an essential trace mineral for optimal health, it is important to remain mindful that the requirements are quite small. The tolerable upper intake level is established at 10,000mcg for women over the age of nineteen and 8,000mcg for those between the ages of 14 to 18. Consuming too much copper increases the risk of unpleasant and potentially fatal side effects like heavy metal poisoning. Having said this, it is extremely rare to consume toxic amounts through whole food sources as it is typically associated with contaminated water or environments.</p>]]></message>

<message><![CDATA[<p>Hi Brittany ‒ it is clear that this company has a fairly substantial marketing budget with the prevalence of its promotion. The Ritual prenatal multivitamin would be well-suited for an expectant mother that follows a nutrient-dense diet and does not have any concerning nutrient deficiencies. As each mother’s nutritional status will vary and there truly is no perfect prenatal multivitamin, I would be mindful of your client's general micronutrient intake through diet and additional supplementation. There are certain instances where an alternative prenatal may align better with the client's symptomatology and/or health goals.</p>]]></message>

<message><![CDATA[<p>The Gut Support Protocol is incredibly supportive for older children and adults too. Our primary recommendation would be to begin slowly and assess if there is an underlying cause or commonality that contributes to their fussiness. Perhaps they are stimulated by certain textures or do not align with certain smells. In these circumstances, it can be helpful to identify foods that the child genuinely enjoys and build-in creative solutions for their elimination alternatives. If beginning with an elimination diet for dairy, for example, this may look like a cashew-based macaroni and cheese with mindfulness around other calcium-rich sources (i.e. chia seeds in an afternoon smoothie). It can also be advantageous, if this aligns with the parents, to foster their curiosity around foods grown from the ground or the ingredients being used in their meals. This provides them with deeper connections and enthusiasm for the foods being consumed on their elimination diet.</p>]]></message>

Dietary silica also does not pose the same potential health concerns as prolonged usage of supplemental silica.</p>]]></message>

Traditional cultures often used heat in their early postpartum practices as it is believed to support circulation without the risk of excess bleeding; similar to that of heating pads for menstrual cramps. I would love to review any literature and/or resources that you might have access to as we have not personally come across anything of concern.</p>]]></message>

<message><![CDATA[<p>In this particular case, we would recommend an emphasis on calcium-rich dietary sources and assess whether vitamin D and/or K2 supplementation would be beneficial for this client. Both of these fat-soluble nutrients work in tandem with calcium, and while more research is ultimately needed, vitamin K2 may help reduce the risk of placental calcification as outlined in the lesson entitled ‘The Role of Vitamin K2’ in Module Two.</p>]]></message>

<message><![CDATA[<p>Hi Jess ‒ thanks for your patience with our reply! While the curriculum places emphasis on specific nutrients for growth and development, there are many micronutrients and trace minerals vital for optimal functioning. We would recommend delving into the collection of fact sheets from the <a href="https://ods.od.nih.gov/factsheets/list-all" rel="nofollow noopener" title="https://ods.od.nih.gov/factsheets/list-all">National Institute of Health</a>. These are intended for health professionals and provide an excellent, research-driven resource for your individual practice.</p>]]></message>

<message><![CDATA[<p>Hi Kelly ‒ thanks for your patience with our reply! We generally recommend caution around maternal elimination diets as the postpartum period can be a particularly stressful time when simple nourishment, without restriction, may be quite challenging. If a mother is motivated to proceed with an elimination protocol and felt it was not too strenuous during this time, she may certainly eliminate the suspected trigger food(s) with increased mindfulness around the vital nutrients each food source provides. With this said, often testing through baby alone is enough to determine if there is an improvement or not.</p>]]></message>

<message><![CDATA[<p>Hi Rochelle ‒ thanks for your patience with our reply!</p><p>Our weekly recommendations are based on the cumulative guidelines set forth by various health organizations (i.e. Health Canada, FDA, and so forth) which offer a precautionary approach to the bioaccumulation of mercury in the food chain. If a mother is interested in consuming seafood more frequently, we would recommend a minimum of three fatty-fish sources per week alongside low-mercury forms like sardines. Sardines are particularly low in mercury as their diets consist of plankton.</p><p>There is no established upper intake level for omega 3s; however, the Melrose high strength fish oil would likely not be necessary for client’s who consume two to three fatty fish sources per week, adequate amounts in their prenatal multivitamin, and/or have no known conditions that would benefit from higher quantities (i.e. postpartum depression).</p>]]></message>

<message><![CDATA[<p>Hi Erin ‒ thanks for your patience with our reply! This can be a difficult area to navigate as the decaffeination process is not always disclosed on labels. Generally speaking, ‘naturally decaffeinated’ is associated with chemical solvent decaffeination. This process often uses chemicals, like methyl chloride, that have been associated with neurological repercussions in higher concentrations. If a client is desiring a similar taste to coffee, I would recommend proceeding with a ‘certified organic’ and/or ‘swiss water’ decaffeinated coffee as these extraction processes use carbon dioxide and water respectively. The decaffeination process also influences the antioxidant content of coffee / tea so it may be advantageous to explore other warming beverages like a homemade turmeric latte.</p>]]></message>

<message><![CDATA[<p>Hi Erin ‒ my heart goes out to this mother and the discomfort that she is experiencing. Carpal tunnel syndrome occurs when there is a thickening or inflammation of tendons passing through the carpal tunnel at the base of the palm. The first step to resolving carpal tunnel syndrome is identifying activities that contribute to its aggravation. If possible, it would be ideal to abstain and/or limit these activities to provide space for the inflamed tissues to recover. If your client is unable to do so, it would be helpful to recommend that she take breaks periodically throughout the day and apply ice to help reduce swelling. Nutritionally speaking, I would recommend a whole foods, nutrient-dense diet with emphasis on anti-inflammatory foods and reducing exposure to inflammatory sources (i.e. excess refined salt, sugar, processed foods, and so forth). I would also recommend that your client consult with their healthcare practitioner to help determine the cause of the impacted tendons. Unfortunately this condition is more common during the postpartum period so it is possible that this inflammation will continue forth. We do have a Q&amp;A video on wrist pain in Module 3 of Postpartum Nutrition.</p>]]></message>

<message><![CDATA[<p>Absolutely! In time this child’s digestive system will adapt to the assimilation of nutrients and liquid from their diet. With the severity of surgeries and frequency of antibiotic therapies, it may take a little longer for this to happen. Nevertheless, it would be beneficial to recommend smaller, more frequent meals to help break down foods more efficiently without contributing additional digestive stress. It is common for symptoms like flatulence, abdominal cramps, loose stools, and potential lactose intolerance to occur following partial colectomies as their intestines adjust to these new requirements. I would also recommend mindfulness around hydration during meals as this increases the risk of a child filling-up on liquid rather than vital micronutrients. Hydration remains essential to their well-being; however, it would be more ideal in between meals or as small sips.</p><p>Unlike food sensitivities, a food intolerance can be tested by this family’s medical, functional, or naturopathic doctor. I would firstly recommend that this client proceed with additional testing to determine if the loose bowels are a symptom of intolerance or sensitivity. If it happens to be a food intolerance, it is important to remain mindful that the Gut Support Protocol would not be applicable as an intolerance is the result of an absence of enzymes rather than an immune response. It would be ideal for this client to slowly wean off enemas; however, this may not be possible if recommended by their healthcare practitioner and/or if required by his surgeries. In such a case, it becomes even more important to support and strengthen his digestive system.</p>]]></message>

<message><![CDATA[<p>Hi Jorgia ‒ thanks for your patience with our reply! We are so sorry to hear that your little once experienced all of these side effects.</p><p>Iron supplementation is a very delicate topic to navigate and typically not an area that CNC’s would support without the guidance of a client’s family medical doctor. An additional challenge arises when anemia is a concern as often babies (and even adults) will require more iron than the recommended dietary allowance and CNCs are ultimately unable to recommend above the RDA. The best recommendation would be to ask if their family medical doctor would be comfortable trying another brand and/or consult with a naturopathic doctor about further options. It can be difficult to source a baby-friendly iron supplement without additional / unwanted additives.</p>]]></message>

<message><![CDATA[<p>It would be beneficial to begin baby’s introduction with low-allergenic, gut supporting foods while proceeding forth with the mindful introduction of allergenic sources. Typically a baby experiencing eczema prior to their introduction is in need of additional gut support.

<message><![CDATA[<p>Hi Amy ‒ there are a few strategies that can be particularly helpful in this case. Firstly, you are not required to summarize the client health context but rather greet your client before delving into your thoughtful questions. Secondly, it can be beneficial to provide your questions and follow them up with a brief rationale before moving onto your recommendations. If there are certain areas that you find particularly difficult in condensing, please let us know and we can help guide your submission further. In the case that you experience difficulties with uploading through our dashboard or WeTransfer, we recommend getting in touch with the Oh Baby Team at support@ohbabynutrition.com to explore additional possibilities.</p>]]></message>

<message><![CDATA[<p>Hi Jaimi ‒ excellent question! First and foremost, we would recommend a food-first approach with choline. Would your client be open to consuming finely grated, grass-fed liver in meals like bolognese or pâté a few times per week? If unable to meet her daily requirements and/or if there is a suspected MTHFR mutation, it can certainly be beneficial to recommend additional supplementation to support that 930mg goal.</p>]]></message>

<message><![CDATA[<p>Hi Jacqui ‒ ultimately more research is needed to conclusively determine why some women develop gestational diabetes and others do not. Often excess weight prior to pregnancy will play a role in this.</p><p>Although uncommon, it is possible for a woman with a seamlessly healthy diet and lifestyle to develop Gestational Diabetes. The placenta requires a variety of hormones (i.e. estrogen, cortisol, and human placental lactogen) that can negatively influence the effect on insulin. This effect typically occurs around 20 to 24-weeks and is tested for between 24 and 28-weeks. As the placenta matures, more of these hormones are produced which increases the risk of developing insulin resistance. Normally, the pancreas is able to make additional insulin to overcome insulin resistance; however, when the production of insulin is not enough to overcome the effect of placental hormones, gestational diabetes can result.</p>]]></message>

<message><![CDATA[<p>Hi team, I'm using the consultant toolkit and have noticed a couple of things. It looks as though the Iron supplementation requirements are listed under the heading magnesium. I could be wrong though :). For zinc intake, why is it important for postpartum mothers to only consume cooked oysters? and is there a difference in Zinc quantities consuming raw vs cooked?

<message><![CDATA[<p>Hi, My pregnancy condition client trial has Chron's Disease. She also had gestational diabetes in previous pregnancy. I know Chron's wasn't covered in our pregnancy conditions module, does this mean it's outside our scope?  Or would it still be ok if I went ahead with the client trial? I don't know a huge amount about Chron's, but I understand that it's an inflammatory disease, so I assume that minimising inflammatory foods and focusing on gut heeling, whole foods would be the way to go.</p>]]></message>

<message><![CDATA[<p>Hello! When it comes to bone broth, traditionally, my culture's recipe calls for soaking the bones for 6- 12 hours before simmering it for 24-48hrs. My understanding is that excess, blood and things most people would not want to eat gets removed in the soaking and draining process. There are so many recipes online but I was wondering if the Oh baby team had any insight into whether or not this soaking &amp; draining process is actually not recommended as you are losing some of the nutrition because the iron is in the red myoglobin. My local butcher says most of the blood is drained out of the animal when it is killed so the red color that comes out from the soaking process is actually from the myoglobin, which is the protein that binds to the iron, which is why they don't soak the bones before beginning the simmering process. Before I begin consultations and advise my clients to make nutrition filled, bone broth l was hoping I could hear back on your thoughts around soaking bones before simmering and I would love to hear any methods/ recipes used by the members of the Oh baby team who make bone broth at home! Thank you!</p>]]></message>

<message><![CDATA[<p>Hi there,</p><p>Just jumping on this thread. I've been a bit stuck in understanding GD. Am I right in assuming that ALL pregnant women become insulin resistant to an extent, and the body creates more insulin to overcome insulin resistance? Do ALL pregnant women burn more fat than carbohydrates to ensure there are stores for the baby? Or only IR women with GD? And that is why they say low carb/high healthy fat and protein diets are beneficial.. And women can get GD because of underlying health issues that are picked up during pregnancy, or possibly because of the new and different amount of hormones in the body...</p><p>I'm just trying to understand this more...</p><p>Many metabolic changes occur within pregnancy and the body’s response to insulin might be one of the more fascinating ones.  “Maternal IR leads to more use of fats than carbohydrates for energy by mother and spares carbohydrates for fetus. Thus, the development of IR serves as a physiological adaptation of the mother to ensure adequate carbohydrate supply for the rapidly growing fetus”. (Study) Therefore, the mother’s body becomes insulin resistant in order to keep glucose in her bloodstream to ensure there is sufficient stores for her baby. Instead, her body switches to a fat burning (ketogenic) state for her own energy needs. The pancreas accounts for this and increases the production of insulin to maintain healthy levels and ensure that baby receives a steady supply of glucose and nutrients. The problem occurs when the maternal diet and lifestyle do not support healthy blood sugar levels, which can be problematic when paired with the occurrence of insulin resistance during pregnancy.</p><p>Thank you so much in advance for explaining this..</p><p>Jaimi :)</p>]]></message>

<message><![CDATA[<p>Hi Rochelle ‒ we appreciate you letting us know, thanks!</p><p>Thoroughly cooking oysters will significantly reduce the likelihood of seafood-related illness. As shellfish, like oysters, continuously draw in water, it concentrates harmful bacteria in their tissue and can infect those who consume it in a raw or undercooked state. Oysters are particularly known for being contaminated with vibrio ‒ a harmful bacteria that can result in diarrhea, vomiting, maternal dehydration, and/or severe illness. This is ultimately why we encourage cooked oysters over their raw form. Most minerals are unaffected by heat so the cooking process will not significantly influence its zinc content.</p>]]></message>

<message><![CDATA[<p>Hi Bree ‒ that is correct. While you can certainly proceed with this volunteer client, we would encourage you to tell her something along the lines of, "I am not well-versed in Crohn’s Disease myself, so please modify my recommendations to best suit your needs and/or speak with your primary healthcare practitioner before implementing anything that we discuss”. As long as this is expressed and documented in your client trial, marks will not be deducted if you happen to recommend something that would be unideal. Since this condition does remains outside a CNCs scope of practice, it would not be appropriate to support her experience with Crohn’s during your consultation. However, you may provide recommendations that help to reduce the likelihood of Gestational Diabetes in her current pregnancy.</p>]]></message>

<message><![CDATA[<p>Hi Elise ‒ it would be ideal for this supplement to contain an organic source of ascorbic acid, a more readily absorbed source of zinc, and more information on its exact quality. However, I do appreciate its allergen-free formula without the addition of artificial flavors or coloring. It also appears to emphasize local, quality ingredients from New Zealand. This would be a suitable, short-term recommendation for a postpartum client experiencing hair loss.</p>]]></message>

<message><![CDATA[<p>That is correct. While iron polymaltose typically has less adverse effects than iron sulfate, iron chelate remains our preferred source for repletion.</p><p>This volunteer would align well with your General Nutrition client trial. However, it would be advantageous to ask your prospective volunteer if she has an additional condition of concern outlined in module three (i.e. anemia, constipation, fatigue, etc). Your Pregnancy Conditions volunteer ultimately must have at least two conditions discussed in the curriculum with corresponding protocols.</p>]]></message>

<message><![CDATA[<p>Hi Lucy ‒ it’s difficult to say with absolute certainty. It is possible that your volunteer client's overall toxic load contributes to a lowered immune status that results in eczema and subsequent colds. Perhaps this family encourages gut supporting foods (i.e. bone broth based soups, easily digestible and anti-inflammatory vegetables, removal of inflammatory foods) to help address the cold symptoms, while internally supporting the root cause of eczema.</p>]]></message>

<message><![CDATA[<p>Hi, my client is in the first trimester and only consuming folate and omega 3 supplements. If she is currently taking 400 mcg of folate (calcium-L-methylfolate), can I recommend to her adding prenatal with 400 mcg folic acid or is that to much of vitamin B9? Is it better for her to switch to prenatal with 600 mcg 5-MTHF and stop taking 400 mcg folate?<br>Thanks!</p>]]></message>

<message><![CDATA[<p>That is an excellent recommendation! In the case that your client is diagnosed with an autoimmune condition, it is possible that adaptogens may stimulate their immune response further and not align well with their body. This will differ from each client and ultimately require the support of a functional medical doctor, naturopathic doctor, etc. With this said, you may certainly proceed with the recommendation while emphasizing that they consult with their healthcare practitioner prior to implementation.</p>]]></message>

<message><![CDATA[<p>Hi Tea ‒ we would recommend a prenatal multivitamin with methylated folate, rather than folic acid, if possible. For the body to utilize folic acid it must first convert itself into the active form of folate. Concerningly, folic acid has been shown to block the body’s receptors for the uptake of active folate and can be problematic if circulating in the bloodstream. If your client has access to a prenatal multivitamin with 600mcg of 5-MTHF, and would like to discontinue her additional folate supplement, we would recommend mindful consumption of folate-rich foods. However, if this supplement was encouraged by a healthcare practitioner it is always advantageous to suggest that she speak with this individual prior to implementing changes to her supplement regimen.</p>]]></message>

<message><![CDATA[<p>Thank you for the answer. The problem is that most of prenatal on our market contains folic acid (400 - 800 mcg) so I am not sure if adding methylated folate is good idea. And I know that activated form is better, but it confuses me will that be too much (prenatal with cca 600 mcg folic acid + 5-MTHF supplement with 400 mcg)?</p>]]></message>

<message><![CDATA[<p>Hi Jane ‒ thanks for your patience with my reply! The beliefs around pre-soaking are quite varied and diverse between cultures. When looking online, you will absolutely find individuals who vehemently believe in each method.  Personally, when using raw bones, I roast them for 30-minutes at 350°F to improve their taste rather than their nutritional qualities. I then place the bones into a slow cooker / large stock pot and cover the bones with cool water and apple cider vinegar, allowing this to sit for 20 to 30-minutes. The vinegar is said to help leach minerals from the bones. As such, I would not want to drain the liquid following the vinegar soak.</p>]]></message>

<message><![CDATA[<p>Thanks for your patience with my reply, Jaimi! The physiology of insulin resistance during pregnancy is absolutely fascinating. As you said, it is designed to limit maternal glucose utilization as a means of shunting an adequate supply of glucose to the fetus.</p><p><b>Am I right in assuming that ALL pregnant women become insulin resistant to an extent, and the body creates more insulin to overcome insulin resistance?</b><br>— Yes, all pregnant women become insulin resistant to an extent. The changes in insulin sensitivity in women with normal glucose tolerance during pregnancy are met by a sufficient increase in insulin production by pancreatic beta cells. However, insulin secretion is insufficient in women with Gestational Diabetes.</p><p><b>Do ALL pregnant women burn more fat than carbohydrates to ensure there are stores for the baby?</b><br>— They utilize *more* fatty acids for energy in comparison to their non-pregnant state; assuming they are not intentionally in ketosis. However, not all maternal energy is derived solely from fatty acids.</p><p><b>And that is why they say low carb/high healthy fat and protein diets are beneficial.</b><br>— This is recommended for those with Gestational Diabetes as their body is not creating enough insulin, therefore their blood glucose levels are elevated. Consuming high carb/low healthy fat &amp; protein would increase this and its associated risks. When insulin resistance becomes severe, it can result in metabolic dysfunction in both mother and baby, both short and long-term.</p><p><b>And women can get GD because of underlying health issues that are picked up during pregnancy, or possibly because of the new and different amount of hormones in the body. I’m just trying to understand this more...many metabolic changes occur within pregnancy and the body’s response to insulin might be one of the more fascinating ones.</b><br>— Yes, correct. Maternal diet and lifestyle, as well as epigenetic contributions influence insulin resistance during pregnancy, but the process through which this occurs is complex and still not completely understood in its entirety.</p>]]></message>

<message><![CDATA[<p>You are most welcome! I am a little confused as you had previously mentioned access to a prenatal with 600mcg of 5-MTHF which is in the preferred form. Nevertheless, it would be ideal for the quantity of folic acid to be lower than the folate or methylated / active form if possible. <a href="https://hr.iherb.com/shipping/hr" rel="nofollow noopener" title="https://hr.iherb.com/shipping/hr">iHerb</a> can be a particularly supportive resource if your client is based in Europe. If a prenatal multivitamin with folic acid is the most accessible option, we would encourage your volunteer to continue supplementing with 5-MTHF due to the importance of folate in the first trimester, keeping in mind that the tolerable upper intake level for folic acid is established at 1000mcg. It can always be helpful to recommend that your volunteer consult with their practitioner before making these changes if uncertain with your recommendation.</p>]]></message>

<message><![CDATA[<p>Hi Jane - it is an absolute disappointment that mother’s are being told this! While we do not always have access to these women during their most precious and vulnerable hours, we do have the opportunity to educate them before birth whenever possible.</p><p>Colostrum can be difficult for new mothers to express because of its thick and sticky consistency. Newborn babies have very small tummies and it takes very little colostrum to keep them nourished and hydrated. Colostrum is incredibly rich and perfectly satisfies all of baby’s needs until a mother’s milk comes in, which is approximately between 2 to 5-days.</p><p>One of the most supportive recommendations that you can make as a CNC is to encourage new mother's to establish skin-to-skin contact as quickly as possible. This has been shown to increase rates of exclusive breastfeeding and breastfeeding duration. Furthermore, it can be advantageous, if within your client’s means, to seek the guidance of an IBCLC to ensure proper latch following birth.</p>]]></message>

<message><![CDATA[<p>Hi! My postpartum with 2 postpartum conditions(stress and hairloss) client is taking Complan Chocolate(it is like a simple to make supermarket bought powder stuff with a decent amount of sugars). Her midwife suggested it and she believes she has done well on it so she continued taking it. She takes it for evening milk supply and quantity. I suggested it may not be such a great product and gave reasons. Her reply was I HEAR WHAT YOU ARE SAYING, AGAIN SHE NEEDS SOMETHING IN THE ARVO EASY AND FAST AND HIGH IN PROTEIN AND FAT AND TASTE GOOD. MAKE IT WITH FULL FAT MILK SO IT HAS A HIGHTER FAT CONTINENT SO SUGAR LEVELS OUT. IT SEEMS TO WORK IN TERMS OF MILK SUPPLY. Sorry for the capitals. How to react to this? What is the best way to 'deal' with this? When mums get a recommendation from a midwife they go by that because it is their midwife. <a href="https://shop.countdown.co.nz/shop/productdetails?stockcode=271282&amp;name=complan-nutrition-formula-double-chocolate" rel="nofollow noopener" title="https://shop.countdown.co.nz/shop/productdetails?stockcode=271282&amp;name=complan-nutrition-formula-double-chocolate">https://shop.countdown.co.n...</a></p>]]></message>

<message><![CDATA[<p>Hi Elise ‒ in this particular case we would recommend empowering your client’s knowledge, as you did, and allowing her to make an informed decision. Sometimes this decision may not align with the wealth of knowledge that you possess, and that is ultimately okay. It would also be advantageous to explore a healthy alternative, if your client is receptive to this recommendation, that satisfies her motivations for consuming the powder (i.e. time-conscious, high protein content, etc).</p>]]></message>

<message><![CDATA[<p>Hi Carley and team, I'm working with a client who's baby is experiencing food aversion when starting solids at 7 months old (they started at 6 months, baby was on medication for six weeks via syringe at 5 weeks old which Mum thinks has contributed) and isn't really keen on putting food in his mouth now. With food aversion, do you recommend we outsource this, and if so, who to? Or are we able to support them? I've recommended she gets in touch with her health care provider as a first step before we work together.</p><p>I also have another client who is experiencing similar, but with her toddler and I'd love to know if you recommend connecting with an OT who specialises in this or someone else?</p><p>Any advice much appreciated :)</p>]]></message>

<message><![CDATA[<p>Hi Jess ‒ proceeding forth with an occupational therapist would be a particularly supportive recommendation to address the root cause(s) of food aversions and empower your client’s with additional strategies to support their little ones during this time. There are many recommendations included in the curriculum that would be helpful to include when supporting families with food aversions (i.e. staying confident and calm at mealtimes, creating positive feeding environments, and so forth). Nevertheless, we would recommend consulting with their healthcare practitioner to rule out developmental delays and/or neurological disorders. When supporting toddlers with food aversions, it can be helpful to assess if there is an underlying cause or commonality that contributes to these aversions. Perhaps they are stimulated by certain textures or do not align with certain smells. In these situations, it can be helpful to identify foods that the child genuinely enjoys and build-in creative solutions to include more nutrient dense foods. Another possibility would be to foster their curiosity around foods grown from the ground and/or include them with the ingredients being used in their meals. This can help to provide them with a deeper connection and enthusiasm for the foods being consumed.</p>]]></message>

I was just reading this: "Primary lactose intolerance (developmental/late-onset lactose intolerance) is caused by a slow decrease in the body’s production of lactase." Would love to know more about when this digestive enzyme comes online. I've also read about the carbohydrate enzyme, amylase, not being present until closer to two years of age, or when babies get all their teeth? Would you agree with this?</p>]]></message>

If proceeding with a high-quality cod liver oil intended for adults, it is paramount that the serving size be adjusted according to baby’s weight and recommended to consult with their healthcare practitioner prior to implementation. We also kindly ask that you communicate the difficulty in sourcing an additive-free supplement in your written submission so that our evaluators have a better understanding of your rationale for choosing this supplement.</p>]]></message>

<message><![CDATA[<p>Hi Jess ‒ symptoms of a non-severe food allergy can be similar to those of a food sensitivity; however, the distinction comes from the timing of the reaction rather than the symptoms themselves. Food intolerances, in comparison, typically manifest as gastrointestinal symptoms, and unlike food sensitivities can be tested by a medical, functional, or naturopathic doctor.</p>]]></message>

Uhh really- so if she is having 2 pills per day (which is the recommendation on the bottle)... this would mean she is over the recommended daily intake of 27mg per day (this would put her at 38.4 without food sources).

<message><![CDATA[<p>That is correct. If your client is open to exploring an additional prenatal, it would be helpful to find a multivitamin that did not contain such a high dose of iron when regularly consuming iron-rich foods without concerns around deficiency. In the case that your client would like to proceed with the Blackmores prenatal, we would recommend complimenting one capsule with a diverse array of nutrient-dense foods.</p>]]></message>

For women of child bearing age for hormonal reasons my understanding is that skipping meals is never a good idea especially for balancing blood sugar levels, but I want to double check this and so I go into the consultation more informed is there more information I could learn about this further and who it is actually suited to? Incase she asks me more or reference and how it works well for her partner or XYZ etc? Thank you</p>]]></message>

<message><![CDATA[<p>Hi Jess ‒ that is correct! Generally speaking, babies are born with lactase activity in their small intestine which naturally declines following infancy. Although quite rare, there have been instances where babies have been born with a complete absence of lactase enzymes that will require additional support from their primary healthcare practitioner.</p><p>Interestingly enough, breast milk provides an incredibly rich source of amylase that helps to support baby’s digestion. The exact development of amylase remains hotly debated and unfortunately lacking research to make conclusive insights. One <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/6608871" rel="nofollow noopener" title="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/6608871">study</a> found that alpha-Amylase activity increased rapidly from low values at birth to approximately two-third of adult values by 3-months of age. It is estimated, though also debated, that the pancreas reaches its full adult capacity at around 2-years.</p>]]></message>

<message><![CDATA[<p>Hi Georgia ‒ we generally recommend a food-first approach with protein when possible. However, if a client is concerned with their protein intake, it can be advantageous to enquire into their motivation before recommending a specific powder. A protein powder may align with client’s on a plant-based diet and/or those interested in increasing / maintaining their muscle mass. Collagen powder, in contrast, would be more supportive for those with inflammatory digestive imbalances, along with those wanting to support their overall joint, hair, nail, and skin health. Ultimately the type of powder will depend on the individual benefits that your client is seeking. In regards to peanut protein powders, its processing involves the extraction of natural oils and fats from roasted peanuts. The result is a powdered peanut product that contains approximately 85% fewer calories from its healthy fats. As fat is critically important during the reproductive years, along with many other health benefits discussed in Module 1 of Foundational Nutrition, we would recommend mindfulness when considering this source.</p>]]></message>

<message><![CDATA[<p>Our thoughts are in alignment when it comes to fasting during the reproductive years. Intermittent fasting can potentially disrupt a woman's fertility due to the effects restrictive eating has on the menstrual cycle and overall hormone production. It is best to recommend that client’s consult with their primary healthcare practitioner prior to the implementation of intermittent fasting as it may not be supportive of their individual health context (i.e. those with diabetes or blood glucose irregularities, history of eating disorders, pregnant or breastfeeding, and those under the age of eighteen). We provide an overview on intermittent fasting in the lesson entitled ‘Popular Dietary Preferences (Optional to Review)’ in Module 2 of Foundational Nutrition.</p>]]></message>

<message><![CDATA[<p>Hi there,<br>I have a question regarding iron supplement. I read on a book (Real food for mother and baby, Nina Planck) something interesting about pregnancy and iron: "Some experts think that pregnant women should not take iron. When you get a virus, the body withholds iron to prevent invading bacteria from enjoying an iron feast. Temporary anemia is the body's deliberate response to infection. You may recall that during pregnancy, immunity is slightly depressed. A natural decline in iron concentration helps protect pregnant women from infection. That's why pediatrician Lendon Smith calls lower iron levels 'innately prophylactic'. He concludes that 'routine iron supplements in pregnancy are unnecessary and unwise except in genuine iron-deficiency anemia' ". I also remember reading from Natasha Campbell-McBride that iron supplement was armful for gut flora, that it makes bacteria grow stronger and does not remedy anemia. <br>What are your thoughts on this?<br>Thanks!</p>]]></message>

<message><![CDATA[<p>Hi there, <br>I read that research form the obstetrician Tom Brewer shown that preeclampsia is caused by protein deficiency. It explains that even before preeclampsia, swelling could be avoid by eating enough protein. If you don't eat enough protein, the liver cannot manufacture sufficient protein to circulate in the blood. Albumin holds water and salt inside the blood vessels so that fluid doesn't leak into tissues. So when albumin is low, you puff up! What are your thoughts on this? I am a bit confused as pre-eclampsia often involves having high levels of protein in the urine. Does that mean that in pre-eclampsia you "don't utilize proteins" and they are directly excrete through urine?<br>Thank you!</p>]]></message>

<message><![CDATA[<p>Hi Eléonore ‒ this will entirely come down to your client’s personal preference after assessing the risks versus benefits. Something like raw, unpasteurized soft cheese carries a substantially higher risk than eggs. The benefits are that cheese contains calcium; however, there are many other calcium rich foods to explore as alternatives. Eggs, in contrast, are one of the most readily available sources of choline, a nutrient that the vast majority of expectant mothers are low in. It would be ideal for an expecting mother to consume cooked eggs, but what if she only likes runny eggs and does not consume an adequate amount of choline-rich foods? In such a case, it would be advantageous to recommend organic eggs as this will substantially reduce her risk of foodborne illness.</p>]]></message>

<message><![CDATA[<p>Hi Kristen ‒ excellent question! Smaller amounts of fats will typically be most supportive for little ones without a gallbladder, while larger quantities may contribute to symptoms of flatulence, bloating, and/or diarrhea. When a gallbladder has been removed, or in rare cases of biliary atresia, the liver will still produce bile necessary for the digestion of fats. Our primary recommendation would be increased mindfulness around balanced meals, and potentially explore smaller, more frequent meals in supporting this little ones digestive health.</p>]]></message>

<message><![CDATA[<p>As always, we recommend a food-first approach with iron when possible. However, in the case of genuine iron-deficiency anemia, we wholeheartedly believe in the importance of additional supplementation and the role CNCs can play in collaboratively recommending a more bioavailable form to support their gastrointestinal system. It is also important to be mindful that in the first trimester, iron requirements are lower due to the absence of menstruation. The innate intelligence of an expectant mother’s body remains absolutely fascinating as it adapts its absorption patterns throughout the duration of pregnancy. In regards to supplemental iron, excess amounts have been associated with feeding pathogenic bacteria in the microbiome, and some practitioners believe that *all* forms of supplemental iron are problematic. With this said, there is absolutely a time and place for additional supplementation as it can be incredibly supportive when taken mindfully.</p>]]></message>

<message><![CDATA[<p>Hi Eléonore ‒ ultimately more research is needed to provide conclusive insights on many of your questions. From the scientific literature that we have available, there does not seem to be an indisputable correlation between low protein intake and preeclampsia. This <a href="https://academic.oup.com/jn/article/133/5/1684S/4558569" rel="nofollow noopener" title="https://academic.oup.com/jn/article/133/5/1684S/4558569">journal</a> affirms, “Despite the belief that low protein intake is associated with an increased risk of preeclampsia, none of these studies indicated reduced protein intake in women with or destined to develop preeclampsia. This is supported by trials of protein supplementation that did not reduce the incidence of preeclampsia”. Dr. Brewer’s whole foods diet is also likely a significant upgrade for many women. So it would be difficult to isolate a sole contributor to these reduced rates of pre-eclampsia.</p>]]></message>

<message><![CDATA[<p>Hello - I have a question regarding prenatal multivitamins and specifically Eagle Tresos Natal which is recommended by many naturopaths and nutritionists in NZ and Australia.

<message><![CDATA[<p>Re : Breasts:Mastitis</p><p>“Wear loose fitting tops and bras. Restrictive clothing can prevent proper milk flow, leading to plugged ducts and mastitis” Some mothers recommended that I wear a tight sports bra because random let downs were causing me a lot of stress in the early postpartum days. My question is: if a mother chooses to wear a sports bra or tight clothes to prevent let downs when she is not ready for a letdown or if she is not nursing, is this a “bad” choice in the beginning days for regulating supply and because it may cause mastitis?</p>]]></message>

<message><![CDATA[<p>Hello~ I have quite a few questions for this Module!<br>(This first one is quite long)<br>Re: Vitamin D</p><p>Vitamin D3 is present in some prenatal supplements like the recommended “Baby &amp; Me 2 Prenatal multivitamin” - it is in the form of the preferred source of Vitamin D3: cholecalciferol however it is not in the fat-based capsule/drop (it seems to be a pressed powder form) — if we recommend our client take it with food that has a fat source (I.e. avocado) would this be sufficient for the new mom’s vitamin D3 needs to be met?</p><p>Additionally, Vitamin D3 is not listed in the supplement facts in IU. How much mcg of Vitamin D3 should we be suggesting the new breastfeeding mother take? I understand in IU’s, 4000 IU’s minimum would be good for enriching a mother’s breast milk, but how does this convert to mcg’s if we are looking for the right Vitamin D3?</p><p>Lastly, I was looking at the food sources of vitamin D3 chart and did some math. If the goal is about 4000 IU minimum that means even if a mother was consuming a large serving of salmon daily (5 oz) for dinner that would only fulfill about 800 IU. If she ate 2 eggs with the yolk for breakfast that would be about 100 IU. That would still leave her with a deficit of 3100 IU of vitamin D3. (Unless she had fish for lunch as well… which sounds like a lot of fish!) In this case I would recommend the mother supplement with cod liver oil, but she would need to supplement with a whopping 7+ tsp of cod liver oil a day to meet her Vitamin D3 needs! Is this right? I know that in an ideal world she could go out and get some sunlight, but given mothers should be resting in bed especially in the first few days if not longer, I wanted to check in to see if nutritionally fish, eggs, and copious amounts of cod liver oil was the only solution for the new mom who cannot get sufficient vitamin D3 through sunlight.</p><p>Also, I was wanted to suggest that perhaps it would be a good idea to note in this module that our bodies are not capable of converting sunlight into Vitamin D3 unless it is hydrated</p><p>Thank you</p>]]></message>

<message><![CDATA[<p>Tresos offers a high-quality prenatal multivitamin and mineral complex; however, the pressed tablet and additional excipients (i.e. silicon dioxide and sucrose) may not be the most supportive option for certain clients. As mentioned in the curriculum, each prenatal contains its own strengths / weaknesses and will require the consideration of your client’s unique nutritional status. Some questions to consider when assessing its fit: Which trimester is your client in? Are there particular nutrients that this client does not meet through diet and/or additional supplementation? Would your client be open to separate supplementation of essential nutrients if missing these through her prenatal? Does she have a history of nutrient deficiencies? And so forth. These questions will help to assess the compatibility of this prenatal for your client.</p>]]></message>

<message><![CDATA[<p>Newborn’s iron levels influenced by cord clamping : I understand that the timing of chord clamping has a high influence on whether or not the newborn has a high or low chance of becoming iron deficient at 3-6 months. What is the procedure like for babies who were born via cesarean surgery route? I can’t imagine the mother had a choice of allowing the chord to keep pulsing during the cesarean surgery procedure. Does this mean that all babies born via cesarean are likely to become iron deficient at 3-6 months? I ask because I wonder if we should be paying extra close attention to the iron intake of a mom who had to go through a cesarean birth. <br>Also, does a mother who goes through a cesarean birth vs a vaginal one lose a lot more/less blood and thereby need to be extra careful about increasing iron levels postpartum?

<message><![CDATA[<p>Hi team :) just a few questions from me regarding supplements.</p><p>I was speaking to my midwife today about Iron deficiency. She has been asking her anemic mothers to take their prescription Iron tablets every other day rather than everyday as they are better absorbed in the body. She said she has noticed a massive decrease in iron transfusions because of this. I also found a study on PubMed about it. <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31413088/" rel="nofollow noopener" title="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31413088/">https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih...</a> What are your thoughts on this?</p><p>In New Zealand the prescribed Iron supplement is Ferrograd which is Dried Ferrous Sulfate 325mg (105 Elemental Iron) which is a form that is not recommended by Oh Baby. However, I am struggling to find a quality brand in New Zealand to support low Iron stores (which is Iron Chelate). For example, BePure Iron Restore <a href="https://www.bepure.co.nz/products/iron-restore" rel="nofollow noopener" title="https://www.bepure.co.nz/products/iron-restore">https://www.bepure.co.nz/pr...</a> is a high quality NZ brand of Iron (Iron Bisglycinate) but only 24mg. If my client was low in Iron and was taking Ferrograd alongside Vitamin C for absorption but experiencing constipation what would your advice be? I was placed on these Iron supplements during both pregnancies as my midwife was adamant that it was the best supplement in NZ to increase Iron stores rapidly - which it did for me.</p><p>Also, I am struggling to find minimal suitable over the counter prenatal multivitamins in NZ. There have been a few recommended in earlier posts however, these are shipped from other countries or require certain licenses to access. There is the BePure <a href="https://www.bepure.co.nz/collections/most-popular/products/prenatal-nurture" rel="nofollow noopener" title="https://www.bepure.co.nz/collections/most-popular/products/prenatal-nurture">https://www.bepure.co.nz/co...</a> which is stated on the suitable supplement list which also contains 24mg of Iron Bisglycinate. However, it is $89NZD for one month supply and is also recommended to take alongside Be Pure multivitamin <a href="https://www.bepure.co.nz/products/bepure-one-daily-multivitamin" rel="nofollow noopener" title="https://www.bepure.co.nz/products/bepure-one-daily-multivitamin">https://www.bepure.co.nz/pr...</a> which is also costly. I am stuck as to what quality Iron/Multivitamins are available in NZ that can be purchased over the counter?</p><p>Any suggestions/advise would be greatly appreciated :)</p><p>Thank you x</p>]]></message>

<message><![CDATA[<p>Hello, I am bit confused when it comes to the developmental signs of readiness. From my understanding (and lack of experience as I've only recently became a mother) some of these signs (turning head, chewing, etc.) can only be noticed once the baby starts to experience food, right? Intuitively, it also seems to me that these signs of readiness might come with practice so starting to give solids to babies who can already sit up by themselves with no support and show interest in food makes a lot of sense. But I thing I just got confused a bit so would be grateful for some clarity :) Many thanks!</p>]]></message>

<message><![CDATA[<p>We are happy to provide further clarification and would like to extend our sincerest congratulations on becoming a new mother! The assessment of developmental readiness certainly becomes easier with practice, and can be observed in certain capacities prior to their introduction of solids. For example, you might notice baby turning their head once happily satiated at a feed, or participating in the act of chewing when observing family mealtime. These signs will strengthen during their introduction to solids but can subtly be viewed in other forms.</p>]]></message>

<message><![CDATA[<p>We have heard similar client experiences with this change in frequency but would recommend that any client with diagnosed anemia and/or low iron status consult with their primary healthcare practitioner prior to the implementation of any supplemental changes. As heme-iron has an incredibly high rate of absorption, some clients may align better with a lower dose of supplemental iron, in the form of BePure Iron Restore, while emphasizing heme-iron sources and strategies to optimize its bioavailability. It is also important to note that CNCs are not permitted to recommend dosage beyond the upper intake level of a particular nutrient (i.e. 45mg daily in the case of supplemental iron).</p><p>As mentioned in the curriculum, each prenatal contains its own strengths / weaknesses and will require careful consideration of your client’s individual nutritional status. For example, which trimester is your client in? Are there particular nutrients that your client does not meet through diet and/or supplementation? Would your client be open to separate supplementation of these essential nutrients if not adequately met? Does your client have a history of nutrient deficiencies? Which supplement form aligns best with your client? And so on. Based on this information, BePure’s Prenatal, without the additional multivitamin, may be an option. Many of our Australian and New Zealand graduates and students speak positively about their experiences with MegaFood’s Baby &amp; Me 2, The Mother’s Blend by Foraged For You, BePure’s Prenatal, and Eagle Tresos Natal (the excipients may not be the most supportive option for certain clients). If there is a particular prenatal multivitamin of interest, please let us know and we would be happy to provide our thoughts.</p>]]></message>

<message><![CDATA[<p>Slow-paced breathing is a popular technique for labor. It involves a deep breath at the beginning of each contraction while your client concentrates on a focal point, breathes rhythmically in through her nose, out through her mouth, and concludes with a deep breath following the contraction. In between contractions, it is recommended that your client breathe normally again. Beyond this, we would recommend the guidance of a Hypnobirthing® educator or breathwork practitioner when exploring breathing techniques in preparation for labor.</p>]]></message>

<message><![CDATA[<p>Hi Jane ‒ we appreciate you bringing this to our attention, thanks!</p><p>Thoroughly cooking oysters will significantly reduce the likelihood of seafood-related illness. As shellfish, like oysters, continuously draw in water, it concentrates harmful bacteria in their tissue and can infect those who consume it in a raw or undercooked state. Oysters are particularly known for being contaminated with vibrio ‒ a harmful bacteria that can result in diarrhea, vomiting, maternal dehydration, and/or severe illness. This is ultimately why we encourage cooked oysters over their raw form. Additionally, most minerals remain unaffected by heat so the cooking process will not significantly influence its zinc content.</p>]]></message>

<message><![CDATA[<p>For clarification purposes, we would recommend moderate consumption of organic, grass-fed beef liver as it is particularly rich in active vitamin A. This would look like 2.5oz approximately three times per week. Furthermore, it is important to acknowledge that this algorithm provides a prediction and does not take into consideration the inhibitors and enhancers that impact iron absorption. If operating under the assumption that 1oz of beef liver equates to 2mg of iron, your calculations would be absolutely correct!</p>]]></message>

<message><![CDATA[<p>We would recommend reviewing the lesson entitled “Food Quality” in Foundational Nutrition when considering the mercury content in different types of tuna. Tuna with lower mercury levels would be okay in moderation and include canned, chunk light, or skipjack. Those with higher mercury levels - such as albacore, yellowfin, bigeye, and ahi - would be best to minimize while a mother is breastfeeding. This will also depend on your client's personal assessment of the overall risks and benefits. Mercury can pass from a mother to her baby through the placenta during pregnancy and in smaller amounts, through breast milk. Exposure to mercury can also affect an infant’s brain and nervous system development which is ultimately why we recommend mindfulness when considering a client's exposure.</p>]]></message>

<message><![CDATA[<p>Excellent question! In addition to probiotic supplementation, we would recommend nutrient-dense meals that include prebiotic and fermented foods. Prebiotic food sources ‒ such as Jerusalem artichoke, garlic, and onions ‒ will help to stimulate growth among pre-existing beneficial bacteria in the microbiome. Fermented foods, in addition, will help aid in the diversification of bacteria. Once a mother's antibiotic course concludes, it can also be helpful to include high-fiber foods, if well tolerated, to promote their digestive health.</p>]]></message>

<message><![CDATA[<p>Most hospitals in Canada and the United States practice immediate cord clamping; however, policies for clamping remain variable and controversial among some healthcare practitioners. A greater association between immediate cord clamping, low iron status, and cesarean births have been observed ‒ though it is possible that a mother’s iron stores at birth remain sufficient enough for baby. It can be beneficial to recommend that your client request tests for hemoglobin, hematocrit, and serum ferritin to better determine her specific iron requirements during the postpartum period.</p><p>The average blood loss for a postpartum mother tends to be higher with cesarean births.

<message><![CDATA[<p>In this context, is the mother or baby deficient in vitamin D? Sufficient maternal supplementation has been shown to improve the concentration of vitamin D in a mother’s breast milk. However, it is difficult to say with absolute certainty that this will sufficiently replete baby’s vitamin D status. As such, we would recommend infant supplementation with 400IU and possibly up to 1000IU if the infant is deficient. It would be best to recommend that your client discuss these recommendations with their family healthcare practitioner to determine the most supportive and accurate dosage for baby if required.</p>]]></message>

<message><![CDATA[<p>For clarification purposes, it remains outside a CNCs scope of practice to suggest or recommend that a mother forgo an antibiotic course. This conversation will ultimately need to take into consideration the risks and benefits alongside her primary healthcare practitioner. The precise risks associated with forgoing antibiotics will depend on the type of surgery and antibiotic prescribed.</p><p>If there is an upcoming surgery that your client has foresight of, it can be helpful to recommend that she store breastmilk to help alleviate concerns and/or stress associated with pumping and dumping. The recommendations set forth in the “Recovering from a Cesarean Birth”, particularly hydration and high-potency probiotics, will be immensely supportive for this postpartum mother. It is also important to note that these recommendations should follow the conclusion of the antibiotic course (excess hydration may dilute antibiotics and impact their overall effectiveness) and/or be taken as far away from the antibiotic course as possible (in the case of probiotic supplementation).</p><p>In regards to a new mother following a cesarean birth with anesthesia and pain management narcotics, it is not always an option to “pump and dump” if a mother hasn’t previously stored milk to satiate baby with. As such, it would likely be a conversation on weighing the risk and benefits of formula ‒ keeping in mind that when anesthesia and pain management narcotics are administered during labor, the baby is already exposed to these substances.</p>]]></message>

<message><![CDATA[<p>Consuming fat-soluble vitamins in a pressed powder form, alongside a well-balanced meal, would certainly suffice. However, we typically do not recommend this because it is unlikely to happen 100% of the time, even with the most conscientious efforts.</p><p>In terms of unit conversions, 1 IU is equivalent to 0.025 mcg. As such, a postpartum mother would require 100mcg of vitamin D3 to begin enriching her breast milk.</p><p>As a mother’s blood serum levels are the strongest indicator of vitamin D status, we would recommend that your client request a 25-hydroxy-vitamin D test with their primary healthcare practitioner. Each mother’s vitamin D status will greatly vary based on their skin tone, sun exposure, dietary rhythms, and so forth. It is also important to note that copious amounts of cod liver oil would not be recommended to a postpartum mother as it remains particularly rich in certain fat-soluble vitamins (i.e. vitamin A and D) and would exceed the upper intake limits for both nutrients.</p><p>We appreciate the additional recommendation, Jane. Vitamin D assimilation, in general, requires so many essential co-factors! That is why a varied, whole foods diet and proper hydration is so important.</p>]]></message>

<message><![CDATA[<p>Hi there, I have a question about coffee, what are the thoughts on coffee consumption? Would I be right to think in moderation if the client is okay with it ie not having stress/sleep issues, and one a day? Would it be best to recommend having coffee after breakfast rather than with as drinking with eating dilutes nutrient absorption? and having coffee on an empty stomach ( say before breakfast) can kick the body into flight/fight mode by triggering cortisol response, not great for hormones? Would it be suggested to add a fat to it like MCT, ghee or coconut oil? Thanks :)</p>]]></message>

<message><![CDATA[<p>Hello,</p><p>I have looked into the 'Thorne Research D3 Liquid' from the supplement guide and I notice they also have a combined D3/K2 too which has 1000IU D3 per serve and 200mcg K2 per serve. Would you refrain from recommending this due to needing to take more to get 2000-4000IU per day, thus increasing intake of K2 to 400-800mcg? is this an unsafe amount of K2? Is it okay to take 2000-4000IU of vitamin D without K2?</p>]]></message>

<message><![CDATA[<p>Hi there!<br>When I was pregnant and early in my postpartum days, my midwife hade me take liquid chlorophyl. I had lost a lot of blood during the labor and if I remember correctly my midwife wanted me to take it to prevent anemia and because I was lightheaded and showing signs of anemia. I know some people who are not pregnant but take it to prevent anemia as it is known as a “proven benefit” of chlorophyll.</p><p><a href="https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/320067#nutrition" rel="nofollow noopener" title="https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/320067#nutrition">https://www.medicalnewstoda...</a></p><p>This article states that “Chlorella is rich in iron and can help prevent iron deficiency anemia.”<br>Additionally, it states that “Findings showed that the body could absorb B-12 from chlorella effectively. This could make chlorella a useful option for some people with a vitamin B-12 deficiency, including vegans and vegetarians.”</p><p> Can I have your thoughts on whether or not chlorophyll supplements are a good options for us as CNC’s to recommend our (vegan or vegetarian) clients take if they do not want to eat liver / take liver supplements to support their iron and B-12 levels? If not, can you provide the reasoning? Thank you so much~</p><p>I ask because I’m not vegan/vegetarian but chlorophyll was the number one recommended iron source for me during and after pregnancy which I find odd since I now know liver is such a good option for people at risk of liver or iron deficiency… however I feel confident that I will come across questions regarding taking chlorophyll in tablet or liquid form so I wanted to pose the question in advance (: Thank you again~</p>]]></message>

<message><![CDATA[<p>If there are no present concerns around caffeine sensitivity, sleep, or underlying stress dysfunction it is often best to consume between mid to late morning so that it compliments our natural cortisol cycle. We will delve into the specific considerations of caffeine during Module 4 of Pregnancy Nutrition; however, you are absolutely correct in recommending that coffee be consumed following breakfast (and ideally away from foods rich in iron and calcium when possible). The addition of a high-quality fat can be particularly supportive in slowing down the absorption of caffeine in their system.</p>]]></message>

<message><![CDATA[<p>The combined supplement may be supportive of client’s who regularly consume large quantities of vitamin D from food sources and/or those getting adequate safe sun exposure. As mentioned in the curriculum, a client’s vitamin D status is best determined through a 25-hydroxy vitamin D test with their primary healthcare practitioner. Supplementing with 2000 to 4000 IU of vitamin D3 has been proven safe for expectant mothers while a tolerable upper limit intake has not yet been established for vitamin K2. As such, I would encourage no more than 200mcg of vitamin K2.</p>]]></message>

<message><![CDATA[<p>Konjac noodles / rice are becoming a popular food source for calorie-restricted diets. The ultimate complication with these foods is that they are incredibly rich in fiber ‒ which generally is a good thing. However, in this particular case, the fiber is incredibly filling yet the konjac noodles are essentially void of any nutritional value. This runs the risk of displacing other essential micronutrients. Konjac products have also been known to cause blockages in the digestive tract, due to their high fiber content, which can expand once consumed. If consuming these products, I would recommend using them on occasion and very sparingly as a small part of an otherwise nutrient-dense meal.</p>]]></message>

<message><![CDATA[<p>Not many mothers know about a newborn’s ability to breast crawl after birth ‒ it truly is an incredible thing!</p><p>While there are many variables that can impact a baby’s latch, it has been shown that babies who are given the opportunity to breast crawl are more likely to develop a proper latch and increase their success with early breastfeeding. However, this is typically not available in a hospital setting for a variety of reasons.</p><p>A breast crawl:<br>‒ requires an unmedicated birth to be successful;<br>‒ is not often achievable following a cesarean birth (11% success rate); and<br>‒ takes time and patience.</p><p>As you mentioned, hospitals typically prioritize newborn practices like measurements and washing of mother and baby. Yet, there are many benefits associated with what is known as “the golden hour”. This is when a mother has at least an hour of uninterrupted skin-to-skin contact with her newborn after birth. It is also interesting to note that babies typically do not begin to attempt the breast crawl until about 20 minutes after birth, after a period of “awakening” following their journey earthside. That said, the duration of skin-to-skin will vary and be deeply unique to each family. Any amount of time spent skin-to-skin will help to support that breastfeeding relationship ‒ especially when breastfeeding is initiated within the first hour, however that is accomplished.</p>]]></message>

The best article that I have personally come across to synthesize this information is through <a href="https://praisetheruminant.com/ruminations/is-it-true-that-cows-need-supplemental-vitamin-b12" rel="nofollow noopener" title="https://praisetheruminant.com/ruminations/is-it-true-that-cows-need-supplemental-vitamin-b12">Praise the Ruminant</a>. In summary, cow’s make vitamin B12 through microbes in their gut. Under normal circumstances, supplemental B12 is not required nor necessary for cows. However, cows do require cobalt to synthesize B12 so supplemental cobalt is given, via salt licks and blocks, in areas known to have cobalt-deficient soils. Typically the only time that supplemental B12 is administered, via an injection, is when the cobalt deficiency runs so advanced that it becomes life-threatening to the cow(s).</p>]]></message>

<message><![CDATA[<p>Hi Jane, thanks for your patience with my reply!</p><p>Chlorella can be a wonderful recommendation for plant-based clients ‒ precisely for its iron, iodine, and vitamin B12 content as you mentioned. Generally speaking, chlorella is a well-tolerated algae but there are a few specific considerations to be mindful of when supporting clients. For some individuals, chlorella can contribute to digestive imbalances like diarrhea, nausea, and/or abdominal pain. Furthermore, it is important to note that if client’s require larger quantities of iron, in the case of true anemia, we would not recommend larger quantities of chlorella as it would contribute to an excess of additional micronutrients like phosphorus and manganese. As the iron in chlorella is non-heme, an additional iron supplement can be taken to support iron levels during this time. Thirdly, I would recommend caution around its iodine levels when supporting clients with thyroid imbalance. For client's with hyperthyroidism, it is often recommended to avoid iodine-rich foods and prioritize goitrogenic foods like cauliflower, Brussel sprouts, and so forth. Goitrogens are naturally occurring substances that block the absorption and utilization of iodine. These food sources should ideally be consumed raw as heat can destroy their goitrogenic effect. Lastly, you often hear that chlorella “detoxifies heavy metals” from the body, which is typically something that we would avoid during pregnancy and/or lactation. However, chlorella actually helps to remove the circulation of heavy metals from the body. It does not actually mobilize them which is why it is safe to consume during these precious life stages.</p>]]></message>

<message><![CDATA[<p>Hi Olivie ‒ excellent question! The impact microwaves have on the nutritional values of food can depend on the duration, temperature, and quantity of water used. For example, in one <a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/jsfa.1585" rel="nofollow noopener" title="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/jsfa.1585">study</a>, microwaving was shown to remove 97% of flavonoids from broccoli. Flavonoids are a classification of plant compounds with vital anti-inflammatory and antioxidant benefits. Furthermore, due to the uneven cooking distribution of microwaves, there is an increased risk of foodborne illness if not thoroughly cooked through to 82°C. As such, it is best to refrain from reheating meals more than once as it can increase the risk of bacterial growth each time it cools. If your client feels deeply connected to the time-efficiency and convenience of a microwave, it is best to recommend that glass or ceramic containers labeled “microwave safe” be used rather than plastic containers and/or wrapping. Plastic containers often contain endocrine-disrupting chemicals that interfere with the natural functioning of our hormones. Additionally, foods heated in plastics, or foods containing fat, are known to leach plastic at a higher rate than other foods. In regards to best practices for safe thawing, we would recommend: placing frozen foods in the refrigerator to thaw; hold the container of food under cool running water; or place the container in a bowl of warm water.</p>]]></message>

I have heard before that smoking foods such as fish or meats is not okay for pregnancy but I've never understood why or if this is true, if its smoked fresh at home is this less risk and why? &amp; cold smoke vs hot? and what are the best ways for cooking, ie on gas, oven, hardwood on bbq for slow cooks, lumpwood charcoal, bbq smoked with brickets or coconut shells, are these allegedly better for smoking than chemical brikets? Is smoking at home better than buying smoked items and not knowing how they were smoked? Is it the smoke that can be carcinogenic in general and therefore should not be done every day due to exposure to this risk? or is the risk more around bacteria growing if eaten not fresh after smoked? I'm a bit confused with it all, hence all the questions -  thanks.</p>]]></message>

<message><![CDATA[<p>I have another question around evening primrose oil in the later part of pregnancy, I've seen it recommended post 37 weeks to ripen the cervix, what is your thoughts on this? and it been high omega 6, which we get enough of in our diets already? I would think and from reading through the omega info that you continue with omega 3 supplementation to help babies brain development, however wondering your thoughts on adding the evening primrose at the end? Thanks :)</p>]]></message>

<message><![CDATA[<p>Water-soluble micronutrients, like vitamin C, are typically best absorbed on an empty stomach with water. However, it is important to remain mindful that supplementation on an empty stomach can contribute to gastrointestinal upset like nausea, abdominal pain, and/or diarrhea. As vitamin C is typically included in prenatal multivitamins, additional supplementation is not often required unless indicated as part of a specific protocol (i.e. GBS). The timing of supplementation will often depend on what resonates best with the client and/or if they are predisposed to gastrointestinal imbalances.</p>]]></message>

<message><![CDATA[<p>Firstly, I would commend your client for supplementing with probiotics during her antibiotic therapies as this will be particularly supportive in rebalancing her microbiome. Generally speaking, we do recommend additional probiotic supplementation following antibiotic therapies as it is not possible to know the exact quantity of beneficial bacteria contained in fermented foods and the recommended daily requirement is quite high. As such, we recommend a short-term protocol of 28-days alongside the encouragement of fermented foods.</p>]]></message>

<message><![CDATA[<p>I am still working with a client whose daughter (recently turned 1) has eczema. I recommended the elimination diet + gut support protocol. She had an allergy test done with her doctor and nothing on the food list came back as a problem. Would this test also show food sensitivities? She's suspecting environmental. Is there an easy at-home test for these (food sensitivities or environmental triggers) that you've used and recommend for a child this young? She mentioned the food allergy test was traumatic for them both so they couldn't even get to the environmental one. Thanks!</p>]]></message>

<message><![CDATA[<p>Hi Katie ‒ excellent questions! The decaffeination process does not typically remove tannins from their beverages. As such, these beverages can inhibit iron absorption, especially when consumed near iron-rich meals or snacks. Please let us know if you have further questions on decaffeinated beverages.</p><p>In regards to your second question, the recommended daily intake of 770 mcg RAE (2566 IU) is in reference to active vitamin A in supplemental or whole food form. In terms of beta-carotene, there has not yet been an established RDA. However, beta-carotene supplementation is considered safe during pregnancy.</p>]]></message>

<message><![CDATA[<p>Likely not unfortunately. The two most common allergy tests ‒ skin prick and blood tests ‒ will measure IgE antibodies, rather than the IgG antibodies associated with food sensitivities. Continuing forth with the Elimination Diet and Gut Support will be the most effective protocol to lower baby's overall toxic load and reduce their manifestation of eczema.</p><p>Also, a gentle reminder that we have to reserve the discussion boards for active students rather than our alumni. For future enquiries, we encourage you to post on our Oh Baby Student Facebook Community.</p>]]></message>

Smoked fish is processed with a variety of controls to help reduce the risk of foodborne illness, particularly listeriosis. When purchasing from the grocer, it is best to consume wild caught smoked fish in a BPA-free container. The hot smoke process will ensure that the temperature was high enough to kill harmful bacteria in comparison to that of cold smoke. Characteristically speaking, hot smoked salmon is flakey while cold smoked salmon is wet.</p><p>While it has been speculated, cancer researchers have not yet determined if smoked fish poses similar health risks to that of processed meat. Nevertheless, if choosing to consume, we do recommend moderation.</p><p>In regards to cooking methods, slower temperatures for a longer period of time is typically preferred over higher temperatures at shorter durations. Gas, oven, and hardwood are excellent options for slower cooks while briquettes often contain additives that are not ideal for smoking fish. Lumpwood charcoal, in addition, does not contain additives but can burn hotter so it is not the best option for slower temperature cooking.</p>]]></message>

<message><![CDATA[<p>You are most welcome! This can be a tricky answer to navigate depending on your client’s dietary preferences. Active vitamin A is typically sourced from animals (i.e. fish liver) or in its synthetic form (i.e. retinyl palmitate or retinyl acetate). The ester forms of retinol should ideally be avoided during pregnancy; however, there are certain circumstances, such as strictly plant-based mothers, who may require synthetic vitamin A with increased mindfulness around remaining under the upper tolerable intake limit set at 3000mcg RAE or 10,000IU. If a mother is not open or comfortable supplementing with active vitamin A, it can be advantageous to emphasize beta-carotene-rich foods as it is a water-soluble nutrient that does not pose risk of toxicity in the body, albeit less potent than active vitamin A.</p>]]></message>

<message><![CDATA[<p>Hi Julianna ‒ excellent question! There is often confusion surrounding high temperature oils and their respective smoke points. The definition of smoke point is the temperature at which a fat / oil begins to burn and smoke. However, smoke point does not determine how well an oil can withstand high heat temperatures before becoming oxidized. When considering a client’s health, knowing how sensitive a fat is to oxidation should be the primary consideration rather than its smoke point. In the case of avocado oil, its monounsaturated fat is considered at risk of oxidation and would be best for low-medium cooking.</p>]]></message>

<message><![CDATA[<p>Hiya :) I have a question regarding Canola oil. Here in New Zealand, there are several brands of canola oil that are grown here, non-GM and cold-pressed. Many of the oils discussed as 'find an alternate for' are heat-treated or GM. If an oil is non-GMO and cold-pressed, does that change it's classification as a bad oil? I assume when looking at cooking with it that the answer would be similar to Julianna's question about avocado oil below? That these oils still oxidise at lower temperatures?

<message><![CDATA[<p>Hi Indigo ‒ that is correct! Seed oils are particularly rich in unsaturated fatty acids that are sensitive and prone to oxidation when exposed to any source of heat, light, and oxygen. Organic and cold-pressed canola oil would be best to consume when unheated (i.e. homemade salad dressings) to reduce the likelihood of oxidation. Furthermore, one of the biggest concerns with seed oils is the overconsumption of oxidized sources and how this contributes to many modern, inflammatory diseases.</p><p>We also received notification on the topic of pasteurized dairy; however, we were unable to locate this post and wanted to ensure that it was not deleted accidentally before receiving a reply. The pasteurization process typically makes milk difficult to digest ‒ this is a topic we will delve further into during the Pregnancy and Baby Nutrition courses. If client’s are enthusiastic about their milk consumption, we would recommend sourcing organic and grass-fed options when possible. If open to consuming other forms of dairy, fermented sources can substantially increase their nutrient value and digestibility (i.e. yoghurt or kefir).</p>]]></message>

<message><![CDATA[<p>The daily requirements are not currently based on elemental calcium but rather the total amount of calcium. This is why knowing the absorbability of various nutrient forms, as well as knowing what inhibits absorption is so beneficial as CNCs. The percentage of calcium absorbed from supplements, along with that of whole foods, will depend on the nutrient source and total amount of elemental calcium consumed at one time. It is ideal for client’s to consume no more than 500mg of supplemental calcium to help maximize its nutrient absorption.</p><p>There are some micronutrients that are becoming recognized and adjusted according to their absorbability. Examples include vitamin A / beta-carotene (RAE) and folate (DFE). In the future, we may see shifts with other nutrient forms like calcium.</p>]]></message>

<message><![CDATA[<p>Hi! Thank you for taking the time to reply to both questions! Re: the question on milk - I deleted the question as I realised the course content was referring to RAW organic dairy which we are unable to purchase for consumption in NZ. Leading on from this though, in wanting to increase protein sources, are protein powders (whey, casein or a rice/pea protein blend for plant-based) considered too processed? It seems many people are reliant on protein powders - are they something to reconsider (I could suggest hemp hearts, chia seeds and nut butters instead) or are there certain brands or kinds of protein powders that would still be encouraged to consume? Thankfully, almost all of our dairy cows in New Zealand is solely grass fed. Thank you for your time :)</p>]]></message>

<message><![CDATA[<p>You are most welcome! We generally recommend a food-first approach with protein when possible. However, if a client is concerned with their overall protein intake, it can be advantageous to inquire into their motivation before recommending a specific powder. A protein powder (i.e. hemp or pea) may align with client’s on a plant-based diet and/or those interested in increasing or maintaining their muscle mass. Collagen powder is typically most supportive for those with inflammatory digestive imbalances, along with those wanting to support their overall joint, hair, nail, and skin health. It also has a comparable protein content to whey, which makes it one of our favorite options. Ultimately the type of powder will depend on the individual benefits that your client is seeking. In truth, I am not a huge advocate for whey or casein as they tend to contribute gastrointestinal symptoms like bloating and flatulence, even in client’s who tolerate dairy quite well. They can also contribute to constipation or loose stools. Hemp protein would be another recommendation to consider ‒ lower protein content but with fewer digestive repercussions.</p>]]></message>

One that seems more clean in general and doesn't contain trans fats is Miyoko's European Style Cultured Vegan Butter. Would you consider this an "ok" option if someone has to be dairy free? It does contain sunflower oil--does it make a difference if its organic? Or does anything with sunflower oil pose a risk? I know having been dairy and soy free for many years, that often sunflower oil is the replacement for anything that is soy free...</p>]]></message>

<message><![CDATA[<p>Hi Carley, when it comes to common food culprits for eczema (e.g. dairy, wheat, etc.), could they worsen the eczema when ingested through breast milk? Baby 7,5 months old, eczema appeared on his upper back around two months ago and sometimes it's getting worse, mainly in the last few weeks when eating solids is regular (daily). After trying out kiwi at 6,5 months he had a rash on his lower arms (from contact with the fruit while eating) that went away after a few days but that area is now on and off with eczema as well. In terms of common food allergens, he's tried egg yolk (not a clear connection yet), wheat (once), and cashew butter (yes, it seems to intensify the eczema on the lower arms). Mother eats dairy regularly so I thought this might also be an issue. Also, in the curriculum wool is mentioned as a fabric that's not recommended for eczema, although it's supposed to be great since it's natural, so I am a bit confused here. Should I recommend the mother to stop using wool clothes? Thank you so much for your support!</p>]]></message>

<message><![CDATA[<p>Hi Breann ‒ Organika has a fairly substantial offering of collagen-based supplements, so it is difficult to provide recommendations without considering each product on an individual level. Having said this, we will delve into supplement quality more precisely during Module 2 of Foundational Nutrition. I also deeply appreciate Organika's emphasis on grass-fed, pasture-raised, hormone and antibiotic-free cattle, along with wild-caught marine sources.</p>]]></message>

<message><![CDATA[<p>We generally recommend caution around maternal elimination diets as the postpartum period can be a particularly stressful time when simple nourishment, without restriction, can be quite challenging. If a mother is motivated to proceed with an elimination protocol and felt it was not too strenuous during this time, she can certainly eliminate the suspected trigger food(s) with increased mindfulness around the vital nutrients each food source provides. With this said, I do want to reaffirm that a maternal elimination diet would not satisfy the volunteer requirements of the Food Sensitivity / Eczema volunteer, as mentioned in the client trial instructions.</p><p>In regards to wool, although it is an excellent natural fabric, its texture can be quite irritating for infants presenting with eczema. If a mother notices a correlation between her clothing and baby's eczema patches, it can certainly be beneficial to bring awareness and recommend less irritating clothing (i.e. linen).</p>]]></message>

<message><![CDATA[<p>Thank you, very useful! Since baby hasn't tried dairy at all yet and egg and gluten don't seem to worsen the eczema, I thought maternal dairy intake might (also) be the cause here (especially since, as mentioned in the curriculum, dairy is a good place to start). But yes - it's clear it won't satisfy the volunteer requirements. Thanks again!</p>]]></message>

<message><![CDATA[<p>Hi Jess ‒ many supplements carry warnings because they are strongly contraindicated during a particular development stage. Other labels may also carry the warning not because there is evidence of harm, but rather a lack of supporting data and clinical testing due to ethical reasons. As sufficient research can not be conducted to verify potential risks or benefits of certain supplements, many manufacturers take a conservative approach. Because of this, even supplements that are generally considered safe and beneficial can carry additional warnings on their labels. It is important for CNCs to personally assess the safety profile, including its ingredients and dosage, before making recommendations.</p><p>In regards to the milk lactose, Seeking Health mentions that the galactooligosaccharides in the ProBiota Immune formula are derived from lactose (milk sugar) using an enzymatic conversion process that is extensively purified. Therefore, there should not be any issues with lactose intolerant babies. In fact, one <a href="https://www.pnas.org/content/114/3/E367" rel="nofollow noopener" title="https://www.pnas.org/content/114/3/E367">study</a> has shown a positive correlation between high-purity galactooligosaccharides and the improvement of symptoms in lactose-intolerant subjects including “50% of the subjects with abdominal pain at baseline reporting no abdominal pain at the end of their treatment”.</p>]]></message>

<message><![CDATA[<p>Hi Jess ‒ included in your upcoming Pregnancy and Postpartum Nutrition courses will be the precise impacts of nutritional deficiencies on babies. Our focus during Baby Nutrition tends to be more broad in nature; delving into the introduction of solids, constipation, food sensitivities, and eczema. Breast milk, additionally, will vary in composition to meet a baby’s individual nutrition and immune requirements. So the impact of deficiency is typically greatest with the postpartum mother rather than a breastfed infant.</p><p>In regards to additional resources, PubMed Central is our favorite database for biomedical literature. We would recommend searching for keywords like ‘DHA’, ‘ infant’, and ‘deficiency’ using the Boolean operator ‘AND’. For example ‘DHA AND infant AND deficiency’. You can then choose additional filters such as clinical studies, date, free articles, and so forth to help concentrate the research most relevant to your specified parameters.</p>]]></message>

<message><![CDATA[<p>You are most welcome! While a maternal elimination diet ultimately falls outside the scope of practice for the Baby Nutrition course, this is an area that you can support upon graduation. We will delve into this more during the Postpartum Nutrition course as dairy could certainly be influencing baby’s eczema. When a suspected trigger is eliminated from the diet, the proteins will disappear from mother’s breast milk in approximately 1 to 2-weeks and should illuminate slow improvement in baby’s eczema patches if indeed the trigger.</p>]]></message>

<message><![CDATA[<p>Hi Sylviamaria ‒ we delve into thyroid conditions during the Postpartum Nutrition course as they are typically most common in this period. However, I am curious if this client’s hyperthyroidism is pre-existing or if it was brought on by pregnancy? If it is a pre-existing condition, it unfortunately falls outside of your scope of practice and certification. I am confident that the recommendations you provide will be immensely beneficial, though I would recommend, especially if your client is on thyroid medication, to check-in with her prescribing physician to ensure your recommendations are not contraindicated.</p>]]></message>

<message><![CDATA[<p>There are certain temperature-sensitive nutrients, like vitamin C, that will denature when exposed to heat. However, if your client is open to consuming a soup-like texture, it would be advantageous to recommend a diverse range of soups and/or smoothies to maximize the benefits of consuming vegetables in both their raw and cooked forms. If your client does not tolerate dairy well, it would also be helpful to recommend a coconut-based cream of vegetables soup.</p>]]></message>

<message><![CDATA[<p>Hi Susanna ‒ excellent questions! Sunflower oil can be extracted using chemical solvents or through expeller pressing. During expeller pressing, the intense friction and pressure creates an atmosphere between 140 to 210°F. As mentioned in the curriculum, seed oils are particularly rich in unsaturated fatty acids that are sensitive and prone to oxidation when exposed to any source of heat, light, and oxygen. If choosing to consume and/or recommend to clients, organic and cold-pressed sunflower oil would be the ideal option, unheated (i.e. homemade salad dressings), to reduce its likelihood of oxidation. The process of cold-pressing typically results in an environment around 122°F. One of the biggest concerns with seed oils is the overconsumption of oxidized sources and how this contributes to many modern, inflammatory diseases. As such, it is important to empower your client’s with healthy alternatives for industrial seed oils (i.e. those with low risk of oxidation) and increase their consumption of omega 3s through food and supplementation if necessary. We would recommend olive or avocado oil before suggesting seed oils as they typically contain a blend of polyunsaturated oils to be mindful of.</p>]]></message>

<message><![CDATA[<p>No apologies necessary ‒ we want you to feel confident in your knowledge and are always happy to provide further clarification! As mentioned in our previous response, seed oils are particularly rich in unsaturated fatty acids that are sensitive and prone to oxidation when exposed to any source of heat, light, and oxygen. If consumed, it is best to choose organic and cold-pressed sources, when possible, to reduce the likelihood of further oxidation. In truth, we would recommend a whole food alternative, rather than a dairy-free product, based on your client’s motivation for consuming vegan butter. For example, if the vegan butter is enjoyed on a slice of toast, perhaps hummus or avocado would be a supportive alternative.</p>]]></message>

<message><![CDATA[<p>Hi Erin ‒ we like Seeking Health’s ProBiota Immune as it contains the preferred forms of beta-glucans and galactooligossacharides, rather than inulin. The prebiotic powder can be dusted onto a mother's nipple prior to breastfeeding, placed on a clean fingertip for an infant / baby to suck, or integrated into a bottle of breastmilk, formula, or puree once introduced to solids.</p>]]></message>

<message><![CDATA[<p>Hi Julianna ‒ generally speaking, the absorbability of nutrients is not something to be particularly concerned with. This holds especially true for client’s that do not present with significant nutrient deficiencies. In the case that a client is diagnosed with anemia, for example, it can be helpful to recommend the separation of these supplements by at least 2-hours.</p>]]></message>

<message><![CDATA[<p>You are most welcome! The most notable concerns with the four categories are their susceptibility to oxidation along with the overconsumption of inflammatory industrial seed oils. When fat molecules become oxidized, they become unstable and form free radicals that can be damaging to the body at a cellular level. As mentioned in the curriculum, the Standard American diet now contains as many as 17x more omega 6s than is ideal. Our ancestors previously consumed a near balanced ratio of omega 3s and omega 6s which was important for optimal health. Both canola and soybean oils are rich in omega-6 fatty acids so we typically recommend healthy alternatives for industrial seed oils, along with an increase in polyunsaturated omega 3-fatty acids like wild salmon. While there is quite a bit of fear around saturated fats, natural sources like coconut oil and ghee, have a very low risk of oxidation when heated in comparison to other categories. Both peanut and sesame oils are rich in omega-6 fatty acids, while flaxseeds are an omega 3 oil. All three, being polyunsaturated fats, are best to consume organic, cold-pressed, and unheated, when possible, to reduce their susceptibility to oxidation.</p>]]></message>

<message><![CDATA[<p>Hi there. I have a question/curiosity about supplements. My husband loves these stress relief antioxidant supplement drinks. he probably has one a day and after reading the supplement quality section of module 2 I got curious and read the ingredient label. The drink contains Ascorbic acid which I now know to be a synthetic form of Vitamin C however the drink also has theNon GMO verified sticker on the front. How are they able to be non gmo verified while also containing synthetic ingredients?</p>]]></message>

<message><![CDATA[<p>The International Unit (IU) is a standard of measurement used for the potency of fat-soluble vitamins, certain hormones, enzymes, and drugs. In the context of vitamin D, the Recommended Dietary Allowance (RDA) is recognized in both micrograms (mcg) and international units (IU) with a universal equivalent of 400 IU equating to 1 mcg. For example, once babies have been weaned it is recommended to supplement them with a minimum of 400 IU or 10 mcg unless strict consideration is made to ensure that they consume sufficient dietary sources of vitamin D3. We hope this helps to provide further clarification but please let us know if not.</p>]]></message>

<message><![CDATA[<p>In this particular instance, the ascorbic acid would not be derived from genetically modified corn. This <a href="https://www.thehealthyhomeeconomist.com/beware-of-ascorbic-acid-synthetic" rel="nofollow noopener" title="https://www.thehealthyhomeeconomist.com/beware-of-ascorbic-acid-synthetic">article</a> provides a good overview when considering the risks and rewards of supplement drinks / tablets containing ascorbic acid. It's important to note that ascorbic acid is quite acidic, and when frequently consumed in liquid form it has been shown to weaken tooth enamel and contribute to pitting of the teeth. With this said, it is equally important to consider the overall benefits from the supplement drink itself. Perhaps it increases daily hydration and/or significantly reduces your husband's stress.</p>]]></message>

<message><![CDATA[<p>Hi Caitlin ‒ for this assignment, it is important to implement all of the daily habits rather than focusing your efforts on a single day (i.e. staying hydrated). As an example, on D3 you will include a picture and short paragraph for the integration of fermented foods. However, you have also been asked to keep up with the previous habits until the end of 7-days (i.e. nourishment and dark leafy greens on D3). These habits do not need to be included in your daily short paragraph response but rather reflected upon in Q3. I hope this helps to provide further clarification but please let us know if further guidance is needed!</p>]]></message>

<message><![CDATA[<p>Hi Breann ‒ listed below are the answers to your questions.</p><p><b>With the food guide, would potatoes (white, red, russet) be in the to enjoy category as with sweet potato? </b></p><p>While potatoes fall under the category of root vegetables, it is important to note that certain varieties (i.e. Russet) will have a greater influence on blood glucose levels than others. As such, we typically recommend sweet potatoes for client’s with blood glucose irregularities as they have a lower glycemic index (less influence on blood sugar) and contain more fiber than other varieties.</p><p><b>With gluten free grains, are they a better alternative to gluten or are individuals eating a gluten free diet still needing to be cautious?</b></p><p>This will depend on a client’s unique symptomatology. For example, some clients do not digest gluten-free grains well. In this case, it would be important to ensure that gluten-free grains are properly prepared as a means to improve nutrient digestion and absorbability.</p><p><b>And my last question is with the micromineral fluoride this is required in the body? </b></p><p>That is correct – fluoride is a trace mineral that helps to stimulate the formation of new bone and strengthen tooth enamel. However, long-term ingestion of excess fluoride has been associated with adverse health outcomes.</p>]]></message>

In the supplement data base, supplements containing vitamin A as retynil palmitate are recommended "exceptionally" for "clients following a plant-based diet, who may not consume any active vitamin A otherwise"? Could you explain why? It would be too much vitamin A for a client already eating food sources of preform vitamin A? Thanks!</p>]]></message>

<message><![CDATA[<p>Hi Erin ‒ thanks for your patience with our reply! It is recommended to wait until a mother’s milk supply regulates around 6-weeks postpartum, unless expressing is required earlier due to separation of the mother returning to work. Beginning earlier than 6-weeks could potentially lead to an oversupply and/or false perception that milk supply is low. However, in the case that low milk supply is of concern, it is important that this mother remain mindful to not increase her supply to the point of an oversupply or new standard to strive for.</p>]]></message>

<message><![CDATA[<p>Hi Eléonore ‒ thanks for your patience with our reply! Unlike most herbs during pregnancy, ginger has a much more robust base of scientific literature as it is reported to be the most commonly used herb in the first and second trimesters. As such, we know that ginger has a proven safety profile during pregnancy due to its extensive historical use as a successful remedy for nausea, when not used in excess, along with the scientific literature that we have available. The recommended intake for expectant mothers is established at 1000mg daily. Other sources will advise not to consume more than 1500 to 4000mg; however, we would not recommend exceeding 1000mg daily during pregnancy.</p>]]></message>

<message><![CDATA[<p>Hi Eléonore ‒ EPO is not recommended during pregnancy, precisely due to the health complications outlined in the lesson on higher-risk methods of natural induction. In the case that a client is supplementing with EPO during their first or second trimesters, it can be advantageous to enquire into their motivation? Perhaps a safer alternative, with similar benefits, can be recommended.</p>]]></message>

<message><![CDATA[<p>Hi Eléonore ‒ our personal insurance, for both consultations and the curriculum, restrict us from recommending nutrient recommendations above and beyond the government’s upper tolerable intake. So while the ester forms of retinol should ideally be avoided during pregnancy and consumed through whole food sources, there are certain circumstances, such as strictly plant-based mothers, who may require synthetic vitamin A with increased mindfulness around remaining under the upper tolerable intake limit set at 3000 mcg RAE or 10,000 IU as fat-soluble vitamins can accumulate in the body. Any intake between 770 to 3000 mcg RAE is considered well within the safety range and is thought to be a conservative estimate for safety purposes.</p>]]></message>

<message><![CDATA[<p>Using leftover brine from traditionally fermented vegetables can certainly speed up the fermentation process of a secondary batch. However, if the brine looks murky or cloudy, it is best to compost the brine as it will have lost its ideal brine volume (most ferments are between 3 to 5% salt-to-water by weight) and be susceptible to scum. You might also consider adding the leftover brine into salad dressings, drinking tonics, cold soups, homous, or egg salad to name a few alternatives.</p>]]></message>

<message><![CDATA[<p>Hi Elke ‒ excellent question! Branched-chain amino acids (BCAAs) contain three specific essential amino acids (i.e. leucine, isoleucine, and valine) typically used to support muscle metabolism, development, and recovery. These three amino acids can be found in varying quantities from sources like chicken, fish, eggs, beans, lentils, nuts, and dairy products. It can also be advantageous to enquire into the specific motivations behind your client's supplements when considering whole food alternatives.</p>]]></message>

<message><![CDATA[<p>Hi Mode ‒ it is great to hear that your menstrual pain has improved!</p><p>We would recommend the exploration of a whole foods alternative, rather than a dairy-free product, while ensuring other calcium-rich foods are well integrated into your dietary rhythms (i.e. sesame seeds, chia seeds, beet greens, spinach, kale, and sardines if aligned with your preferences). For example, if the vegan butter is enjoyed on a slice of toast, perhaps hummus or avocado would be a more supportive, nutrient-dense option to consider. There is a list of traditional and health-forward fats recommended on page 12 of the OBA Food Guide that you may find helpful.</p>]]></message>

Or are those two concepts not correlated? <br>Other than antibiotics, c-section, stress and a poor diet/excess sugar, are there other reasons that gut health would be affected? Thanks!</p>]]></message>

<message><![CDATA[<p>Liquid chlorophyll can be a wonderful recommendation for plant-based clients ‒ precisely for its iron and magnesium content as you mentioned. Generally speaking, liquid chlorophyll is a well-tolerated supplement but there are a few specific considerations to be mindful of when supporting clients. For some individuals, chlorophyll can contribute to digestive imbalances and/or skin irritations. Furthermore, it is important to note that if client’s require larger quantities of iron, in the case of true anemia, we would not recommend larger quantities of liquid chlorophyll as it would contribute to an excess of additional micronutrients like calcium. As the iron in chlorophyll is non-heme, an additional iron supplement can be taken to support iron levels during this time. In the case that your client consumes other heme-iron sources like chicken, eggs, and seafood, chlorophyll supplementation may not be necessary. We would also encourage strategies to improve iron absorption if the client follows a strict plant-based lifestyle.</p>]]></message>

<message><![CDATA[<p>Hi Elise – these natural remedies are indeed specific to PUPPS and obstetric cholestasis as they pose a greater risk to baby than other sources of itching. As a CNC, you can inform your client that their symptoms sound similar to those experienced with PUPPS or cholestasis after assessing the location, severity, symptoms, and likelihood of occurrence. As it stands, there is no testing available for PUPPS; however, a medical doctor can diagnose a PUPPS rash by examining your client's skin. In the case you suspect obstetric cholestasis, you can recommend that she consult with her primary medical doctor about further blood work that includes liver function and bile acid tests prior to implementing your thoughtful recommendations</p>]]></message>

<message><![CDATA[<p>In this case it can be advantageous to ask the recipe developer directly if they have experience with alternatives and their respective quantities. Typically with baking, we would recommend ghee (if well tolerated), applesauce, mashed bananas, avocados, nut butter, pumpkin puree, and so forth. For pie crusts, specifically, we have seen success with the use of coconut oil, however, the quantity will likely need to be adjusted.</p>]]></message>

<message><![CDATA[<p>Hi Krishma ‒ thanks for your patience with our reply! Although the research is limited, there have been promising correlations between camel milk, <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29705422" rel="nofollow noopener" title="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29705422">gut health</a>, and <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5626114" rel="nofollow noopener" title="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5626114">diabetes</a> specifically. However, we cannot confidently speak to the impact of pasteurization on camel milk, as it seems to differ from companies and countries. Research on this is still quite new, given its longstanding traditional use in raw form, so it remains unclear if the pasteurization of camel milk will change the benefits related to gut health. Camel milk also does contain less lactose than cow’s milk, making it a more supportive option for client’s with lactose intolerance.</p>]]></message>

<message><![CDATA[<p>As a baby’s immune system is still developing at this time, it would be best for the eggs to be hard-boiled and organic if possible. These will be the most effective recommendations to reduce the likelihood of foodborne illness, particularly salmonella. After 5-years of age, the risk of salmonella greatly reduces in children.</p><p>We typically delve into this topic during the Pregnancy Nutrition course; nevertheless, it would be advised to assess the risks versus benefits. Something like raw, unpasteurized soft cheese carries a substantially higher risk than eggs. The benefits are that cheese contains calcium; however, there are many other calcium-rich foods to explore as alternatives. Eggs, in contrast, are one of the most readily available sources of choline, an essential nutrient for baby’s brain development and cognition. While it would be ideal for baby to consume hard-boiled eggs, it would be advantageous to recommend organic and pasture-raised eggs to reduce the risk of foodborne illness for families who prefer soft-boiled.</p><p>In regards to the amount of time boiled, this will depend on the specific altitude of the family. Generally 8-minutes will produce a solidified yolk that is not crumbly or overcooked.</p>]]></message>

<message><![CDATA[<p>Hi Erin ‒ if your client is open to consuming coffee between mid to late morning, this would help compliment her natural cortisol cycle and reduce the potential impacts (i.e. elevated levels of anxiety, jitteriness, or stress) when her cortisol production is highest upon waking. The addition of high-quality fat and protein will be particularly supportive recommendations in slowing down the absorption of caffeine into her bloodstream.</p><p>It would be advantageous to recommend an alternative nut or seed milk in place of soy if possible. The extent to which soy isoflavones exert weak estrogenic or anti-estrogenic effects (how they bind to estrogen receptors in the body) is currently the focus of considerable scientific research and depends on the existing levels of hormones in the human body. This will be particularly relevant if your client is expressing hormonal irregularity, estrogen dominance, hypothyroidism, and/or polycystic ovary syndrome.</p>]]></message>

<message><![CDATA[<p>Hello, by any chance, do you have a good resource that I can refer a client to which help to decipher and understand blood test results? One of my participants in the client trial recently had her bloods tested at her GP and they gave her a very brief rundown which she wasn't satisfied with but she doesn't have the money to see a naturopath at the moment so wants to try to understand her results by herself. Optimal levels for early pregnancy etc. Thank you in advance. Erin</p>]]></message>

<message><![CDATA[<p>Hi Erin ‒ excellent question! It ultimately comes down to what resonates best with your client. While many mothers feel that they benefit from consuming their placenta, there are others that do not respond as positively. It is a subject that we personally do not advise on as it is highly controversial and there is unfortunately not enough scientific literature to provide proper recommendations.</p>]]></message>

<message><![CDATA[<p>Hi Sara ‒ thanks for your patience with our response! While sulfa allergies and sulfite sensitivities are not typically correlated, it is possible that your client’s food-related symptomatology is connected to a sulfite sensitivity. As such, it would be advantageous to recommend that your client seek additional support, as you did, while encouraging mindfulness around sulfite-containing foods and beverages. Having said this, sulfites are not an area that you are required to advise upon during the Foundational Nutrition course.</p>]]></message>

<message><![CDATA[<p>Hi OhBaby ladies, <br>A question about PCOS. My client has PCOS and I may have missed it but is there anything mentioned in our course material in regards to this? I am mainly thinking of certain nutrients that could be of importance to assist in this. I understand we are not doctors or health professionals and I am not diagnosing but it would be great if I somehow can be of help. Is it known at all that depression and PCOS somehow may have to do with one another?<br>Question about the appendix. Client's appendix is removed last year, could this potentially cause any complications anywhere along pregnancy or while giving birth?<br>Then they(as in doctors/hospital) were worried about preclampsia but blood pressure has been great. Anything I could or should add to my client in regards to preclampsia?<br>She also experiences heart burn and indigestion. Do you feel after reading this that any of these are results of one another? As in a domino effect?<br>All mentioned above is in regards to 1 client.</p>]]></message>

<message><![CDATA[<p>My client's baby was jaundice when she was born and it improved, so they didn't take any further action, but now she's a month old and the pediatrician said she still looks a bit jaundice and she isn't gaining as much weight as they would like. She's exclusively breastfeeding on demand and they pediatrician recommended to supplement with formula for a week to help increase calories and clear the jaundice. My client isn't opposed to this and I know this is out of our realm of recommendations, but was wondering if there is any further research or recommendation on this. Thank you!</p>]]></message>

<message><![CDATA[<p>Hi Elise ‒ we are in the midst of developing our Fertility Nutrition course that will thoroughly address the condition of PCOS. Until then, it is believed that insulin resistance may be a root cause of PCOS. As such, it would be advantageous to find healthy alternatives and/or reduce foods that contain higher amounts of fructose (i.e. tropical fruits). Some studies have also shown a correlation between PCOS, anxiety, and/or depression. The exact mechanism remains unknown but there are a few theories. Insulin resistance changes how the body makes certain hormones which can contribute to prolonged stress and depression. Additionally, PCOS is associated with inflammation throughout the body which can elevate cortisol levels and increase the likelihood of depression. While it is important that this client consult their primary healthcare practitioner if experiencing depression, it can be helpful to address possible nutrient deficiencies outlined in the lesson ‘Postpartum Depression’ in Module 3 of Postpartum Nutrition.</p><p>There is no known correlation between the removal of an appendix and its impact on pregnancy. However, recent studies have theorized its role in the immune and digestive systems, specifically in regards to its capacity to reduce serious infection and replenish the microbial balance following illness (i.e. diarrhea). It is difficult to say with absolute certainty that these conditions are interconnected. However, there are many recommendations discussed in the pre-eclampsia (if concerned), heartburn, and indigestion protocols that would be immensely supportive of your client's conditions.</p>]]></message>

<message><![CDATA[<p>Hi Erin ‒ if your client has access to their blood test results, there should be a “range of normal” for each test selected. This will be the most accurate method of gauging results without the support of a holistic practitioner who may feel ‘normal ranges’ do not necessarily equate to ‘optimal ranges’. The reference ranges can also differ between countries which makes it difficult to provide a comprehensive resource.</p>]]></message>

<message><![CDATA[<p>There unfortunately is not enough scientific research on the subject to provide a definitive or speculative answer. However, omega 3s and choline have been known to be particularly supportive of Fetal Alcohol Syndrome thus far. Children with FAS frequently have atypical eating rhythms related to behavioral and physical difficulties which may prove challenging on restrictive diets like GAPS. Nevertheless, I strongly believe that early, low pressure introduction to a diverse range of nutrient-dense foods would be important for their overall health.</p>]]></message>

<message><![CDATA[<p>Hi there I am interested in low iron and the risk of miscarriage increase. I understand we would never advise on such a thing, however I was told by a naturopath ( after having 3 miscarriages myself) that if iron levels are under 50 ( ferritin) then the increase in risk of miscarriage increases by some huge % , at the time i didn't think to ask her were this research came from. She explained a similar thing with breastfeeding in first trimester, she said the risk of miscarriage then increases the chance to 70%.. Is this something you have heard of and could speak more on? <br>&amp; what would you do if you had a client who had low iron  - around 20, and was wanting to conceive right away but wouldn't supplement with iron or eat meat? How would you go about explaining the risks/recommendations, as it would take a long time to increase through non heme foods but then been respectful of food choices? Speaking from a place of experience with a family member, thinking it would be helpful to know for future clients. Thank you</p>]]></message>

Some questions for their family to consider: Could this mother increase the frequency of nursing? Is latch an area of concern? Does baby seem to be thriving (not all healthy babies follow weight gain exactly as charted)? If this family decides to proceed with formula, it is important to ensure that mother’s milk supply is not negatively impacted. This can be done by using a breast pump to maintain supply and reduce the likelihood of clogged ducts.</p>]]></message>

<message><![CDATA[<p>Hello, my client for FN has Crohn's disease and is gluten intolerant , I have done some light reading about Crohn's and was hoping to see if there is anything I should know before I begin planning my clients meals, as this disease is very new to me. Are there certain things that may cause a flare up? I read that high fibre foods (such as raw vegetables and fruit), nuts seeds, and gas producing foods such as lentils, beans, legumes. Would it be wise to encourage soaking and souring these gassy foods, or steer clear all together? any help would be much appreciated.</p>]]></message>

<message><![CDATA[<p>Hi there, question regarding vitamin K2... Is it safe to supplement with 1 spray of VitD3/K2 (180microlitres) when there is 100microlitres of vitamin K1 in prenatal? Would this be good for a pregnant woman who does not have dietary forms of vit K2, and has one child already with multiple cavities at age 3? Thank you :)</p>]]></message>

Here they said that babies don't have enzymes needed for mushroom digestion. So they don't recommend them before age 3. So is there any need to delay them because of that or not?

<message><![CDATA[<p>Hi Breann ‒ listed below are the answers to your questions.</p><p><b>Is there a resource for which specific foods contain specific nutrients/vitamins/minerals?</b></p><p>We will delve into essential micronutrients during the Pregnancy, Postpartum, and Baby Nutrition courses. In these courses, you will learn the role that each micronutrient plays in the health of mother and baby, while also considering its potential risks of deficiencies. Furthermore, you will explore the best food sources for each micronutrient and learn how to tell if your client is confidently consuming adequate amounts through food alone, or if additional supplementation may be necessary.</p><p><b>Is there a specific time frame when sending your client the forms, when they should have them back to me? and then the time between when they hand them back to me and when the appointment should be?</b></p><p>This entirely depends on what timeline works best for you and your volunteer. If multiple weeks pass between completion of their health intake forms and conducting the consultation, it would be advantageous to check-in on if their answers remain accurate or if there are additional concerns / areas that they would like to address in consultation.</p><p><b>After having the client trial, are we to follow up with the client with an email/written copy of everything we talked about/suggested or should it be their responsibility to be taking notes?</b></p><p>Some students prefer to solely integrate their recommendations in conversation, while others may consider additional graphics (i.e. concrete copy or shared screen through Zoom pending on the mode of consultation) or a follow-up email. This is entirely up to what feels best for your personal practice. Speaking from personal experience, it is often beneficial to summarize recommendations in written form as there is, more often than not, a lot of new information for them to digest. With this said, you are not expected to include more than is required in the written client trial instructions for submission.</p>]]></message>

<message><![CDATA[<p>Hi Tea ‒ we immensely appreciate the additional insight, thank you!</p><p>The cell membranes of mushrooms contain an insoluble fiber called chitin that does not break down easily in the human digestive system. There unfortunately is a lack of scientific research available on the topic, particularly in regards to babies and young children, however, the process of cooking is thought to break down the chitin-rich cell membranes of mushrooms. Having said this, if it is culturally recommended to avoid mushrooms until a certain age, there certainly is no harm in doing so. Mushrooms do not provide any specific nutrients that cannot be found in other nutrient-dense, whole food sources.</p>]]></message>

<message><![CDATA[<p>Hi Jaimi ‒ are both units of measurement in micrograms or microliters? Typically 1μg of liquid equates to 1μL. However, this conversion may slightly differ if one or more supplements is in powdered form. As there is no upper limit intake yet established for vitamins K1 and K2, 280mcg would be considered safe during pregnancy.</p>]]></message>

<message><![CDATA[<p>Hi Shjarn ‒ thanks for checking-in with us! First and foremost, we would encourage you to acknowledge that Crohn’s Disease falls outside your scope of knowledge by affirming to your volunteer, “I am not entirely well-versed in Crohn's Disease myself, so please modify my recommendations to best suit your needs and/or speak with your healthcare provider before implementing anything we discuss here today.” As long as that is expressed and documented in your written submission, marks will not be deducted if you happen to recommend something that would not be ideal for your client. When a client is expressing an acute flare-up, it would be best to avoid raw fruits and vegetables, along with fibrous foods like lentils, beans, legumes, and nuts.<br>Furthermore, the practice of soaking and souring is highly recommended, outside of acute flare-ups, as it will increase their digestibility and Crohn’s predisposes people to micronutrient malabsorption.</p>]]></message>

For general digestive and intestinal health, strains of lactobacillus and bifidus will be the most supportive in helping to restore balance of the gastrointestinal tract. In regards to specific charcoal recommendations, there truly are so many! The activated charcoal supplement from Organika would be our top recommendation. It is available in both capsule and powder form.</p>]]></message>

<message><![CDATA[<p>Yes, white rice is a beneficial source of resistant starch. There are also other foods offering resistant starch that are less refined like bananas or potatoes. We'll be adding more about this to the Foundational Nutrition curriculum soon due to its current popularity. In regards to the safety profile of reheated food, it is best to follow the practices outlined in the lesson entitled ‘Food Safety Guidelines’ in Module 4 of Pregnancy Nutrition. The duration of refrigeration before consumption, temperature at which food is stored, along with the temperature it is reheated will all factor into its risk.</p>]]></message>

<message><![CDATA[<p>There unfortunately is a lack of scientific research in determining the potential contribution of iron deficiency to miscarriage. In regards to the correlation between breastfeeding and miscarriage, I would recommend delving into these posts by <a href="https://kellymom.com/pregnancy/bf-preg/bfpregnancy_safety" rel="nofollow noopener" title="https://kellymom.com/pregnancy/bf-preg/bfpregnancy_safety">Kelly Mom</a> and <a href="https://www.llli.org/new-study-on-breastfeeding-and-miscarriage-cause-for-concern" rel="nofollow noopener" title="https://www.llli.org/new-study-on-breastfeeding-and-miscarriage-cause-for-concern">La Leche League</a>.</p><p>In the case that your client is not open to supplementation or heme foods, it would be advantageous to recommend strategies that improve absorption of non-heme iron and/or ensure that her recommended prenatal contains an iron chelate like ferrous bisglycinate. Iron chelates are less likely to bind to oxalates and phytates from foods, which can reduce absorption rates in the body. As there are many factors linked to miscarriages, more than we know truthfully, I would recommend enquiring into your client’s motivation for not supplementing with iron as it would be highly recommended in the case of low iron status to address the significance without causing additional stress.</p>]]></message>

<message><![CDATA[<p>Hi Julianna ‒ excellent question! Alpha-GPC and CDP-Choline are popular supplements in the nootropics community. Both have the ability to cross the blood-brain barrier more readily than choline bitartrate, which is why they are frequently recommended for Alzheimer’s, Dementia, and after a stroke. However, it is generally suggested to avoid both forms during pregnancy as there is not enough known to confidently recommend them. With this said, there is no evidence of harm to the fetus. Although, Alpha-GCP has been known to have more maternal side effects, including heartburn, headache, insomnia, dizziness, skin rash, and confusion.</p>]]></message>

<message><![CDATA[<p>Hi Sara ‒ thanks for including the additional link! First and foremost, I am curious if there is a particular motivation behind your client consuming low-fat yoghurt? Our preference would be towards a full-fat, unflavoured yoghurt (that contains fewer additives like caramel color and citric acid) as healthy fats are essential for our wellbeing, create long-lasting satiation, absorb fat-soluble nutrients, support brain function, and are especially critical during the reproductive years. If wanting to balance your client's breakfast with protein, we would recommend exploring additional sources like quinoa porridge, protein-rich seeds, or a savory egg and oatmeal bowl.</p>]]></message>

The topics of endometriosis and fertility are really quite massive and difficult for us to summarize through a discussion board post. However, the Oh Baby Team is hard-at-work on developing our Fertility Nutrition course which will include endometriosis in depth. If this is an area of interest, Nicole Jardim has some excellent articles on endometriosis and fertility. Also, in application to your client trial, you are not expected nor required to address these conditions but rather apply the knowledge that you have gained from the Foundational Nutrition course.</p>]]></message>

<message><![CDATA[<p>There unfortunately is limited research on the roles vitamin C and zinc play in mediating Group B Streptococcus. However, there is more considerable literature available for vitamin C, zinc, and other forms of streptococci. As other streptococcus bacteria are influenced by these nutrients, we are confident that vitamin C and zinc play important roles in strengthening the immune system and reducing the likelihood of GBS.</p>]]></message>

<message><![CDATA[<p>Hi Breann ‒ the Environmental Working Group’s 'Dirty Dozen' list provides an important framework for countries outside of the United States, as many countries import conventional produce from the United States. With this said, it is important to note that pesticide exposure can vary between countries and some even have local resources available, similar to that of the 'Dirty Dozen'.</p>]]></message>

<message><![CDATA[<p>Sucralose can be a controversial sweetener to navigate. Recent literature has illuminated concerns around its influence on beneficial bacteria, specifically the Lactobacillus and Bifidobacterium species in the microbiome, which help protect against pathogenic bacteria. Sucralose has also been shown to raise blood sugar and insulin levels in certain individuals, which may be an important consideration if your client is expressing blood glucose irregularities. When considering a reduction and/or healthy alternative, it can be beneficial to understand your client’s motivation for consuming sucralose and encourage change(s) that align with these motivations.</p>]]></message>

<message><![CDATA[<p>Hi Breann ‒ excellent question! The most important consideration when it comes to cooking oils is their smoke points and susceptibility to oxidation. Coconut oil has a smoke point of 350°F and would be suitable for cooking higher temperatures, while fractionated coconut oil has a lower smoke point and should ideally be used for low to moderate temperatures or blended into smoothies / salad dressings. As MCT oil is a concentrated source of medium-chain triglycerides it may promote weight loss and boost energy. Coconut oil, comparatively speaking, has fewer medium-chain triglycerides and a slightly different composition that may promote ‘good’ cholesterol in the bloodstream and reduce the likelihood of heart disease. Each oil will offer slightly different benefits, much like the diversification of foods.</p>]]></message>

For this particular section we are anticipating that you will identify the categories to include, reduce, and find healthy alternatives for, while elaborating on how these connect to your client’s primary health concerns, how they can be integrated into her diet, and if they ultimately resonated with your client volunteer. Depending on your client’s dietary rhythms and health concerns, there may be more or less categories to address in each section.</p>]]></message>

<message><![CDATA[<p>Curious, if mother was not taking antibiotics, however was GBS+ (without antibiotics given), would the recommendation still be a 28 day protocol post birth (although I am aware from prenatal nutrition that the birthing woman may also be on probiotics during third trimester as well, especially if known GBS is present). Would the probiotic recommendation be for almost all birthing women postpartum (unless no antibiotic use, vaginal delivery, and no GBS present, <b>as well</b> as consuming a probiotic rich diet)?</p>]]></message>

<message><![CDATA[<p>Hi Elise ‒ our heart truly goes out to this mother as she navigates these waters.</p><p>While both of these conditions would ultimately need to be supported and supervised by your client’s primary healthcare provider, my initial concerns, if ceasing antiepileptic medication, would be if this mother fell while pregnant or breastfeeding, and remained the sole caregiver at home. The health of the mother is pivotal to ensure the health of the baby.</p><p>In regards to digestive support, it is often best for client’s that have undergone gallbladder removal to consume smaller amounts of fats as larger quantities can contribute to symptoms of flatulence, bloating, and/or diarrhea. Similarly speaking, smaller, more frequent meals would help to ease digestion further.</p>]]></message>

<message><![CDATA[<p>Hi Priyanka ‒ the EER calculation includes quite a few factors (i.e. age, sex, weight, height, and physical activity) that make it difficult to summarize through a discussion board post. However, there are many online resources available to assist with this, including an academic article that can be accessed <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1784117" rel="nofollow noopener" title="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1784117">here</a>. To determine the EER for a client in her third trimester, you would add their unique non-pregnant EER and 452 together. The EER calculation is merely for your personal practice and not a requirement for your upcoming Foundational Nutrition client trial. I hope this helps to provide clarification!</p>]]></message>

<message><![CDATA[<p>Hi Breann ‒ thanks for your patience with our reply! As our original response was a little unclear, I have included an amalgamated version below.</p><p>As saturated fat is least susceptible to oxidation at higher temperatures, your recommended sources (i.e. coconut oil, ghee, and butter) would be ideal for higher temperature cooking. Fractionated coconut oil is not typically recommended for cooking purposes; however, it can be used in lower heat applications as mentioned previously. I would encourage mindfulness on the amount of fractionated coconut oil used as it has been known to cause nausea in higher amounts, and comparatively is more expensive than other oils.</p><p>In terms of benefits, MCT oil offers a concentrated source of medium-chain triglycerides that can promote weight loss and boost energy. Coconut oil, comparatively speaking, has fewer medium-chain triglycerides and a slightly different composition that can promote ‘good’ cholesterol in the bloodstream and reduce the likelihood of heart disease. Each oil will offer slightly different benefits, much like the diversification of our foods.</p>]]></message>

<message><![CDATA[<p>Hi Kristen – thanks for checking with us! The IgG and IgA antibodies are quite complex and unfortunately do not communicate a definitive answer. Both IgA and IgG are typically delayed responses, and can include both food sensitivities and/or eczema. However, it is also important to note that cow’s milk protein allergy can be a non-IgE response, which makes IgE testing the most reliable method. Testing for IgA and IgG tends to be quite controversial as it is difficult to reproduce results efficiently.</p>]]></message>

<message><![CDATA[<p>Hi Tea ‒ Food Protein-Induced Enterocolitis Syndrome (FPIES) is caused by an allergic reaction to one or more ingested foods that inflame the small and large intestines. The symptoms of excessive vomiting and diarrhea less commonly, appear between 2 to 4-hours after ingestion and can lead to serious dehydration. FPIES is a non-IgE allergic reaction which means it will not pose the risk of anaphylaxis.</p><p>The Gut Support Protocol would be highly beneficial for children with diagnosed FPIES. However, you would not want to reintroduce the trigger foods as you would with the food sensitivities protocol. The primary medical treatment is strict avoidance, and while most children outgrow FPIES by age 3 or 4, reintroduction would be done under doctor’s supervision. It would also be important to ensure there are no trigger sources in their recommended supplements. The most common triggers include rice, cow’s milk, dairy, and soy. If the trigger(s) remain unknown, it is vital that your client proceed with their primary medical provider. There are no laboratory or skin tests available to determine delayed food allergy, so the diagnosis will be based on history, symptoms, physical examination, and sometimes a medically supervised oral food challenge.</p>]]></message>

<message><![CDATA[<p>Hi Kayla ‒ thanks for your patience with our reply!</p><p>Probiotic supplementation is recommended for many postpartum mothers. In addition to the factors listed above, probiotics would also be important considerations for those with compromised digestion, yeast infections, or thrush. If a mother was not administered antibiotics, but tested GBS+, additional probiotics would not be necessary unless there was an additional factor present (i.e. thrush). If a mother had a cesarean birth and/or was administered antibiotics during delivery, supplementation with an emphasis on fermented foods would ideally be recommended for at least 2-months postpartum.</p>]]></message>

<message><![CDATA[<p>Hi Mei – best wishes on your upcoming client trial!</p><p>While these conditions unfortunately fall outside the scope of practice for Foundational Nutrition, we will be delving into food sensitivities during the Baby Nutrition course. The Gut Support Protocol that will be presented is particularly supportive for adults navigating food sensitivities as well. However, it is important to note that food allergies ultimately remain outside a CNC’s scope of practice, as will be communicated during the Baby Nutrition course. Pre-existing hypotension would also need to be supported by your volunteer’s primary healthcare practitioner.</p><p>For remedies to support hay fever, stinging nettle and vitamin C-rich foods can be especially beneficial as they act as a natural histamine in the body. Local bee pollen, additionally, has been shown to reduce inflammation and strengthen immunity, although it would not be appropriate for a client with a known or suspected allergy to bee pollen. Depending on your client's stress levels and motivation for consuming coffee, it may also be important to consider a reduction / healthy alternative to better support her stress response and adrenal function.</p>]]></message>

<message><![CDATA[<p>one more thing. with this prenatal having no iron is that an issue? Or is it better to be supplementing with a seperate iron supplment on top of the prenatal if there is a need/requirement for the individual client? My understanding from the iron info is the first trimester you don't loose so much because pause in menses but come 2nd &amp; 3rd tri you can, and i guess building up in preconception is the most ideal, so would you be leaning toward a prenatal with iron or not so much and just look to supplment iron on top of it if needed?Do some pre natals not have iron because it interferes with other nutrient absorption in the supplment?  If taking the iron supp is it okay to take alongside the prenatal or does it interfere with absorption of any other nutrients in it? Thanks so many questions within that haha.

<message><![CDATA[<p>Hi Georgia – this will ultimately depend on your client’s unique health context. For example, if your client is consuming ample sources of heme iron, additional supplementation would not be required. However, if they have been diagnosed with pregnancy-related anemia, a higher concentration of iron may be recommended by their healthcare practitioner. As always, we would recommend a food-first approach, rather than additional supplementation, when possible. Though you may notice some prenatal multivitamins will not include calcium and iron together to ensure maximum absorption of their respective nutrients. Furthermore, some clients may benefit from a little top-up of iron, in which case it would be beneficial to have a prenatal multivitamin that includes a bioavailable form. There unfortunately will not be a one-size-fits all option for prenatal multivitamins as requirements differ so vastly between clients. I hope this helps to provide further clarification.</p>]]></message>

<message><![CDATA[<p>For Vitamin A, I noticed chicken liver was not listed as a food source on the chart. When doing a quick search online, I see here <a href="https://www.urmc.rochester.edu/encyclopedia/content.aspx?contenttypeid=76&amp;contentid=05028-1" rel="nofollow noopener" title="https://www.urmc.rochester.edu/encyclopedia/content.aspx?contenttypeid=76&amp;contentid=05028-1">https://www.urmc.rochester....</a> that 400g of chicken liver has 34,119 IU of Vitamin A. however to equate it to 2 oz to compare it apples to apples to other food sources listed on the chart for vitamin a, I calculate it to be just 4,874 IU per 2oz. Is this accurate?</p>]]></message>

<message><![CDATA[<p>Hi Mei – you are most welcome! If your client has been diagnosed with anemia, it would be best that she proceed with her primary healthcare practitioner as anemia can contribute to or at least exasperate hypotension. In the case iron deficiency has been confirmed through blood test, it can be helpful to  recommend strategies to improve nutrient absorption. These include: consuming iron with foods rich in vitamin C; avoiding consumption of iron with tannin-rich foods, beverages, and calcium; cooking in a cast iron pan; and/or soaking grains prior to consumption.</p><p>For hypotension specifically, hydration is incredibly important as dehydration can exacerbate low blood pressure. I would also recommend mindfulness around reducing refined carbohydrates and encouraging smaller, more frequent meals as these can both positively impact blood pressure.</p>]]></message>

When exploring beverage options, I would recommend enquiring into her personal motivation for consuming said beverage. For example, if your client enjoys the taste of coffee, and does not have a known / suspected iron deficiency, then tannins would not be an area of concern.</p>]]></message>

I would consider swapping to a dairy free formula, however this is expensive and could cause more stress on the family with the infant perhaps not taking to the new formula. Are we within our right, to advise to change to a dairy free formula to improve the eczema as well as eliminating dairy through diet? Or is the dairy broken down and processed so much that typically the formula doesn't affect them?</p>]]></message>

<message><![CDATA[<p>Hi, I was reading about choline and how its levels in mother's breastmilk is constant. The document in PP nutrition states, "Choline is present in human milk, and is especially important for fetal and infant development. The hint that choline is important for infant development comes from the fact that in human milk, the supply of choline remains constant.”  However, I am curious about Vitamin D &amp; iron. Since breastmilk does not naturally contain vitamin D3 &amp; iron, why are mother's told to supplement these nutrients?  Am I missing a piece? Thanks for your input!!</p>]]></message>

<message><![CDATA[<p>Hi Elise ‒ thanks for your patience with our reply! In an ideal world, it would be recommended to complete a full elimination; however, as you mentioned above, this may not be possible for each family. If baby consumes dairy in other forms, then eliminating all of those, while leaving the formula, will be enough to see an improvement if dairy is indeed a trigger source. Then, the gut support will be enough to help baby tolerate the formula and hopefully resolve the sensitivity.</p>]]></message>

<message><![CDATA[<p>Hi Hella ‒ great question! As a methyl donor, folate will cover for choline if intake is insufficient; however, it will not replace the requirement for choline as this nutrient is needed in the body for other reasons. Methylation also works most efficiently when all methyl donors, like folate and choline, are present and available for use. With this said, if a client is consuming sufficient dietary sources, choline supplementation would not be necessary or required.</p>]]></message>

I see that marine algae is a plant based source DHA, but would that also be classified as a food to delay? is there any risk of allergy?<br>Would I recommend marine algae supplementation to the family following an omnivorous diet? or would the most reasonable recommendation be to just wait until the recommended 8+ months to introduce food sources of DHA?</p><p>Thank you</p>]]></message>

<message><![CDATA[<p>Thanks again for your patience with our reply, Tea! The OBA Team was surprisingly busy finalizing our migration to a new learning platform and preparing for a new student intake this coming week. Nevertheless, let’s delve into those questions.</p><p>Beta-glucans are a preferred source of prebiotic when it comes to supplementation. While there has not been much scientific literature to support their role in immune function for children specifically, beta-glucan supplementation certainly seems promising! In the interest of immune health, the Low Immunity Protocol in Pregnancy Nutrition would be particularly helpful in supporting parental concerns around immune function. However, it is important to note that honey and syrups are not recommended for children under 12-months of age.</p><p>As guidelines can differ between countries, we can only speak to our personal experience and expertise. The benefit of a true allergy is that an immediate response usually makes it easier to identify the trigger food. However, allowing four full days between introductions provides CNCs and parents the opportunity to monitor for symptoms of food sensitivity.</p>]]></message>

The OBA Team was surprisingly busy finalizing our migration to a new learning platform and preparing for a new student intake this coming week. Nevertheless, let’s delve into those questions.</p><p>While consuming large doses of highly concentrated green tea in extract form has been shown to have adverse effects on thyroid function, it ultimately remains unclear how, and if, other forms of green tea in lower concentrations impact our thyroid gland. Catechins may exert an anti-thyroid effect and matcha is higher in catechins than regular green tea. However, it is important to note that all studies to date have been conducted on animals and we are not able to conclusively confirm the effects on humans. There currently is no literature present to suggest that a cup of matcha would negatively influence the health and function of our thyroid. We may suggest to avoid higher doses for those with hypothyroidism, but regular consumption would likely be low risk.</p>]]></message>

Nevertheless, let’s delve into your question.</p><p>That is correct! Some antimicrobials will reduce beneficial and pathogenic bacteria; however, this is not the case with the antimicrobial agents found in coconut oil. Although this <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6923562" rel="nofollow noopener" title="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6923562">research article</a> was concentrated on the microbiome, it provides a good representation of coconut oil’s effects on pathogenic versus beneficial bacteria. For human gut microbes, lauric acid, which is predominantly found in coconut oil, was shown to have low antimicrobial activity against commensal lactic acid bacteria, but high antimicrobial activity against pathogenic bacteria which suggests that lauric acid may modulate intestinal health. Furthermore, this <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/11890570" rel="nofollow noopener" title="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/11890570">scientific article</a> illuminated a correlation between monocaprin, a monoglyceride of caprylic acid found in coconut oil, and how it may reduce the risk of GBS bacteria.</p>]]></message>

<message><![CDATA[<p>Hi Jenn – excellent questions! As mentioned in the lesson on ‘DHA &amp; other healthy fats’, grass-fed beef and marine algae would both be adequate options for DHA at this time. DHA requirements have not yet been established for babies and can be difficult to estimate from dietary sources, breast milk, and/or formula. As such, we would recommend offering three servings of age-appropriate DHA-rich foods per week, servings will vary between 6 and 12-months of age, along with additional supplementation due to the importance of DHA in brain development and cognitive function. Unlike fish and shellfish, DHA does not contain the same allergenic protein responsible for the majority of allergic reactions.</p>]]></message>

<message><![CDATA[<p>Re: Iron. I have been reading additional research regarding iron supplementation &amp; potential overload. I came across this study and was wondering if anyone would be able to provide insight. It suggests that iron can be the cause of fungal and bacterial infections. One of the author's states, "Since it is known that Iron is an essential growth factor for C. albicans and that endotoxin [e.g. LPS, aka Lipopolysaccharides from Bacteria] causes a significant fall in serum iron, the importance of iron as a factor in nonspecific resistance to infection with C. albicans induced by endotoxin was evaluated in vitro and in vivo.” Elin R.J. Wolff S.M. (1974).<br>I am curious what this would mean for mother's that experience issues of thrush &amp; candida overgrowth. Of course I understand if this is not feasible for the team at this time.

<message><![CDATA[<p>Hi I am doing some research on prenatal vitamins as both my clients have indicated they would like to start a new one as they have finished theirs and are open to hearing any suggestions I have. I was going to suggest mega food baby and me 2 or the mothers blend as is suggested on the supplement data base but wanted another Australian option or one more readily available in Australia. I looked at the one I took (thorne) and it definitely didn't cut it and another by Bioceuticals that was suggested by a friend. I then found my naturopath suggested this one which has a few different formulations which I found interesting for the different stages of pregnancy and breastfeeding. I was wondering whether I could ask you to have a look at the ingredients list for me as I did find it a little confusing. It seems ok to me but I really don't want to recommend anything that isn't and I would feel more confident if I had a second opinion. <a href="https://naturobest.com/prenatal-trimester-23-plus-breastfeeding/" rel="nofollow noopener" title="https://naturobest.com/prenatal-trimester-23-plus-breastfeeding/">https://naturobest.com/pren...</a></p>]]></message>

<message><![CDATA[<p>You are most welcome, Julianna!</p><p>If a client is desiring a similar taste to coffee, decaffeinated coffee would be a supportive alternative. However, I would recommend proceeding forth with a ‘certified organic’ and/or ‘swiss water’ decaffeinated coffee as these extraction processes use carbon dioxide and water respectively, rather than chemical solvents that have been associated with neurological repercussions in higher concentrations. The decaffeination process also influences the antioxidant content of coffee so it may be advantageous to explore other warming beverages like a homemade turmeric latte.</p>]]></message>

<message><![CDATA[<p>It can be difficult to determine if a baby requires supplementation as there are several factors to consider, like maternal status and breastmilk / formula / food consumption. However, the lesson entitled ‘Supplementing a Baby’ can be tremendously beneficial when navigating the possibility of supplementation.</p><p>For plant-based babies, a greater emphasis should be placed on iron-rich foods and absorption strategies once introduced to solids. Generally speaking, iron supplementation would not be advised without the support of a client’s family medical doctor. Though, if baby has not reached developmental readiness around 7-months of age, I would encourage their family to request a blood test for hemoglobin to determine baby’s specific needs. As long as iron is a focus with first foods, supplementation is usually not a concern.</p>]]></message>

<message><![CDATA[<p>Hi Team, <br>When it comes to assignment BB-M2-A2 it states that no allergenic foods should be offered as first foods. When listing a food for each nutrient, for example the best food sources for DHA are coming from potential allergenic foods and there are are foods that I would recommend over another for example for Vitamin D3, I would suggest salmon over pork (of course after safe introduction and if no allergic reaction) but I just want to be sure that we are to include no allergy foods at all here?</p>]]></message>

<message><![CDATA[<p>Fermented foods can last a long time if preserved and stored correctly. However, the exact length of time will vary depending on many factors like its fermentation process, storage methods, conditions, saltiness of brine, and so forth. For probiotic applesauce specifically, it can vary between 4 to 12-weeks and can be monitored using sight or smell. If the smell repels you, or it looks moldy / mushy, it would be best to compost the remainder of probiotic applesauce.</p>]]></message>

<message><![CDATA[<p>Hello! I have a client who says that biotin makes her break out/worsens her acne. She has tried the Seeking Health and Pure Synergy prenatals, both of which cause her to break out on her forehead. When she stops taking them, her skin clears up. Both her dermatologist and esthetician confirmed that biotin (and possibly B-12) can make acne worse. Is this something the Oh Baby team has come across before? I'm struggling to find a high-quality prenatal that contains a low amount of biotin, or no biotin at all. The best I've found is Mama's Select prenatal + DHA. Any thoughts or suggestions for what I could recommend to her? Thanks!</p>]]></message>

<message><![CDATA[<p>Hi Natalie – our heart truly goes out to your client as she navigates the complexity of nutrient interactions. Biotin is known to displace pantothenic acid, also known as vitamin B5, which can contribute to or worsen acne. In such a case, it may be helpful to recommend additional B5 supplementation for those prone to deficiency. Vitamin B12, on the other hand, is a little more difficult to navigate as supplementation can change the gene expression of skin bacteria, which may lead to acne-promoting inflammation. Generally speaking, biotin and vitamin B12 are contained in the vast majority of prenatal multivitamins available; however, if it is financially accessible for your client, it may be advantageous to individually supplement with primary nutrients of importance, like vitamin D3 and omega 3s, while alternating between a high-quality prenatal multivitamin every other day. A poorer quality prenatal multivitamin risks additional adverse health affects and absorption challenges.</p>]]></message>

<message><![CDATA[<p>You are most welcome, Natalie!</p><p>That is correct – depending on your personal assessment of this client’s health intake forms, food journal, and information gathered during consultation, additional nutrients specific to her phase of pregnancy may also be considered.</p><p>In regards to the Mama’s Select Prenatal, I am not the biggest fan of its nutrient forms or excipients, although I do commend the intention to find a biotin-free prenatal supplement. The combination of lower quality nutrients (i.e. calcium carbonate, zinc oxide, ferrous fumarate) and additives can increase the likelihood of constipation, flatulence, nausea, and impact absorption of nutrients in the bloodstream. It also remains unclear where the fish oil is sourced from, and if it is contained in a jar with problematic plastic polymers. Fat-soluble vitamins are more susceptible to absorbing toxins from plastic containers than water-soluble vitamins. The primary cause for concern is the way that certain polymers mimic hormone pathways in the thyroid gland, which would be of particular concern during pregnancy and postpartum.</p>]]></message>

The topic of IVF is so expansive that it would be difficult for us to synthesize in a single comment, and without assessing your client’s unique health context. While we deeply appreciate your commitment in supporting this client’s fertility concerns, the topic of IVF unfortunately falls outside a CNCs scope of practice and certification. This ultimately must be supported by her primary healthcare practitioner.</p>]]></message>

<message><![CDATA[<p>Hi Lauren ‒ thanks for checking with us! When baby’s develop eczema before their introduction to solids, it is often indicative of a need for further gut support and will likely worsen as baby explores foods throughout their introduction. I hate to say this, but your volunteer would unfortunately not satisfy the requirements for the Food Sensitivities / Eczema client trial if unable to follow the elimination protocol beyond a change in formula. However, you can certainly proceed with supporting this client’s introduction of solids, if baby is between 4 to 6-months of age, with emphasis on gut support where applicable.</p>]]></message>

<message><![CDATA[<p>It depends. Are they regularly consuming dairy, soy, or other highly allergenic foods that are suspected to aggravate baby's eczema? As one of the main objectives of the Gut Support Protocol is to identify food sensitivities and reduce exposure to triggers, this volunteer must require support with the elimination of an allergenic source(s). Although this client would certainly benefit from your guidance following graduation, general whole foods would unfortunately not align with the requirements of this specific client trial.</p>]]></message>

<message><![CDATA[<p>Hi there. I have a question about M2,A2-nutrient exploration. I am a little confused by the contents of the first supplement, the prenatal vitamin. It states that the prenatal vitamin has 1330 mcg DFE of Folate and then in parentheses gives the conversion to folic acid which is 800mcg. I understand these to be the same measurement just in different forms, obviously one better than the other, but I am confused as to which form is dominant in this supplement? is it folate or folic acid? if it were the latter wouldn't it state "as folic acid" in parentheses?</p>]]></message>

<message><![CDATA[<p>Hi Kara ‒ the FDA created the Dietary Folate Equivalent (DFE) measurement to facilitate consistency in measuring the quantity of folate across different food and supplement sources. With supplement fact labels, the DFE measurement will be listed first, followed by its specific nutrient form in parentheses (folic acid in this case). Comparatively speaking, a supplement that contains 'Folic Acid' will be measured in 'mcg' rather than 'DFE'. I hope this helps to provide further clarification, but please do not hesitate to reach out if further questions arise.</p>]]></message>

We have an Instagram post that can be accessed <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/CFKpmsBFmKq/?utm_source=ig_web_copy_link" rel="nofollow noopener" title="https://www.instagram.com/p/CFKpmsBFmKq/?utm_source=ig_web_copy_link">here</a> if interested. Having said this, your submission should focus on the written contents of the meal, while applying what you have learnt during the last two modules. For example, the two ingredients emphasized for fire cider are ginger and turmeric.</p>]]></message>

<message><![CDATA[<p>Maternal vitamin D supplementation is generally sufficient; however, the precise dosage will depend. A mother’s blood serum levels are a strong indicator of the vitamin D status of her breast milk, so it would be helpful to ask if this postpartum mother’s vitamin D levels have been tested recently and/or if she is open to additional testing with her primary healthcare provider. Most women with limited sun exposure could benefit from at least 4000 IU, though more may be needed to replete stores and sufficiently enrich breast milk. We will delve into these considerations further during the Postpartum Nutrition course.</p>]]></message>

<message><![CDATA[<p>If there are no concerns around maternal status, additional supplementation would not be necessary. However, this will depend on the unique health context of a mother and her baby (i.e. maternal supplementation, sun exposure, dietary rhythms, etc). It can also be helpful to recommend that a postpartum mother undergo seasonal blood tests to confirm adequate levels while breastfeeding her baby.</p>]]></message>

<message><![CDATA[<p>Excellent question! Storing peanuts and/or peanut butter in a cool, dry place is certainly optimal.

<message><![CDATA[<p>Hi Kayla ‒ we received an additional notification on bugleweed and wanted to ensure that it was not accidentally deleted before you received a reply. As bugleweed is known for suppressing thyroid function, it would not be recommended for those with postpartum hypothyroidism as it can inhibit the stimulation of thyroid hormone production. However, in the case of hyperthyroidism, it would be advantageous to include as bugleweed can inhibit the binding of antibodies that mimic thyroid stimulating hormone, which can prompt the thyroid gland to release excessive amounts of thyroid hormone into the bloodstream.</p>]]></message>

<message><![CDATA[<p>Hi Kayla ‒ thanks for your patience with our replies! Basal Body Temperature is an incredibly fascinating and useful tool in detecting subclinical thyroid dysfunction. However, it is not always definitive due to the risk of human error. As such, it should be used as a complementary tool to identify potential thyroid complications.</p><p>As for testing, normal resting basal temperature is between 97.8 to 98.2 °F. Generally speaking, body temperature will lower just before ovulation and at the onset of menstruation. Therefore, if recording temperatures, it is recommended to wait 2-days following menstruation and chart temperatures for 7-days following. Consistent temperatures lower than 97.8˚F may be indicative of hypothyroidism, whereas  temperatures greater than 98.2˚F may be indicative of hyperthyroidism.</p>]]></message>

<message><![CDATA[<p>Hi Lisa – this will be unique to each baby and most beneficial to follow their respective hunger / satiation cues. Some babies will be content with three daily meals between 9 and 12-months, while others may require snacks at this time. Usually around 12-months of age, when food takes priority over breast milk and/or formula consumption, snacks should be well integrated into their dietary rhythms.</p>]]></message>

<message><![CDATA[<p>Hi Eléonore ‒ in an ideal world, it would be advantageous to introduce the top allergenic sources, like fish and cow’s milk, while empowering your client’s understanding of its importance and relevance. For instance, mindfully introducing these highly allergenic sources will help to inform their baby’s immune system to develop tolerance and protect against an overactive response later in child or adulthood. However, this may not align with the dietary preferences or beliefs of each family that you support. As such, additional consideration may be necessary to ensure baby is meeting their intake of essential nutrients like DHA and choline.</p>]]></message>

<message><![CDATA[<p>Hi Elke – we typically recommend a few baby-size spoonful's once or twice per week as the Tolerable Upper Limit Intake for vitamin A is established at 600 mcg RAE between 0 and 12-months. It's also important to remain mindful that the type of liver will influence the amount of active vitamin A baby is consuming. For instance, a quarter-ounce of beef liver contains approximately 548 mcg RAE while the same quantity of chicken liver warrants approximately 282 mcg RAE.</p>]]></message>

<message><![CDATA[<p>Hi Susanna ‒ excellent questions! The diet of fish can greatly impact its lipid profile so the precise quantities will vary between species and supplements (identified on the Nutritional Facts label). For general guidelines, we recommend supplementation for the entire duration of a mother’s breastfeeding journey while taking into consideration a non-breastfeeding mother’s dietary consumption of omega 3-rich foods (i.e. fatty fish approximately three times per week). Given that most postpartum mother’s do not meet their daily requirements of omega 3s and DHA, both whole food sources and supplementation remain quite essential in repleting lost stores. The precise balance, however, will look differently between clients.</p><p>Excess intake of vitamin A has been shown to contribute to birth defects and decreased bone mineral density. However, this is most common with the use of synthetic vitamin A, which is found in supplements and topical products. An estimated 200 cases of vitamin A toxicity are reported worldwide each year from mega doses of vitamin A supplements or from consuming liver from arctic animals. To remain within a CNCs scope of practice, it is important to remain mindful that your recommendations do not exceed the upper intake levels for precautionary measures.</p>]]></message>

<message><![CDATA[<p>Hi Eléonore ‒ when we look to ancient cultures for wisdom, many babies have been fed grains (and pulses) alongside their introduction to solids. However, it is important to note that these sources have been carefully prepared using traditional methods. As mentioned in the curriculum, we generally recommend that these foods be delayed until baby is reliably consuming three meals daily with ample amounts of food at each meal. This ensures that more bioavailable foods are prioritized while their digestive system continues to mature.</p><p>In addition to protein, it’s important to remain mindful that eggs are one of the most readily available sources of choline – an essential nutrient for baby’s brain development and cognition. However, in the case eggs are suspected as a sensitivity, they can be successfully eliminated and reintroduced with mindfulness.</p>]]></message>

<message><![CDATA[<p>Hi Kerstin – the literature around maternal peanut consumption and risk of peanut allergy in childhood remains quite conflicting. However, it's important to acknowledge that the majority of publications showing a correlation between maternal consumption and increased sensitivity were published prior to 2010. Recent <a href="https://media.jamanetwork.com/news-item/children-lower-risk-peanut-tree-nut-allergies-moms-ate-nuts-pregnant/" rel="nofollow noopener" title="https://media.jamanetwork.com/news-item/children-lower-risk-peanut-tree-nut-allergies-moms-ate-nuts-pregnant/">literature</a>, in contrast, suggests that maternal consumption (in the absence of maternal allergies) decreases the overall risk of a child developing allergies.</p>]]></message>

<message><![CDATA[<p>Hello, I have a a few questions with regards to coffee/caffeine.<br>In postpartum conditions under constipation it's written that "it has a diuretic effect which draws water away from the bowels". I have a client trial who suffers from constipation postpartum and she mentioned she usually goes to the toilet after she drinks her coffee (which is actually caffeine-free since she said she's afraid caffeine would negatively impact her baby's sleep through breast milk). I am now a bit hesitant to recommend her to stop drinking her coffee as a measure of support for her constipation...</p><p>Generally I've heard many women (and men) that need coffee to go to the toilet so I am a bit confused on:<br>1. Why do people go to the toilet after they drink coffee?<br>2. If it's said to draw water away from the bowels than why does still point 1) happen?<br>3. What about decaf? Any thoughts / studies on consuming decaf during pregnancy / postpartum and does it have any influence on bowel movements?</p><p>Many thanks for your support!</p>]]></message>

<message><![CDATA[<p>Regarding iodine--all of the clients I work with are dairy free. Many are also egg free, and beans, beef are common issues as well. So for anyone dairy+ free, they should automatically on a supplement and it should be 290 mcg/day? Or somewhat lower in case they are eating some forms of iodine in their daily routine? I've heard that you can get too much iodine--is there a risk here with supplementing? And some of clients also have thyroid issues--if they are already on meds does that mean they shouldn't supplement with iodine outside of a doctor directive?</p>]]></message>

<message><![CDATA[<p>I have another question related to the supplements database as it pertains to me personally (as I am pregnant)  but also how I might make recommendations to clients in pregnancy or postpartum.  I'm currently under the care of a holistic provider who has muscle tested and currently has me taking Perfect Supplements 2 beef liver capsules per day and 1 tsp Rosita cod liver oil in addition to prenatal vitamin ( I was doing Garden of Life My Kind and then switched to Klaire Labs prenatal and am considering Seeking Health because of the higher choline. My question is--she is not concerned about the vitamin A because it's all coming from natural sources (or at least from the cod liver oil and the beef liver) but I see in your supplements database that you made the note under the beef liver capsules and Rosita cod liver oil to be cautious in pregnancy. I don't know what 2 beef liver capsules would be for vitamin A (doesn't say) but 1tsp Rosita is 3,900 IU. So I'm assuming that if the upper intake is 10,000, that, combined with a prenatal shouldn't be a big concern? Is your note of caution under the supplement database just to make people aware to "add up"the IU, like what I'm currently doing and just make sure?</p><p>Extra note. Perfect Supplements says on their site: Taking 4 capsules of Perfect Desiccated Liver every day has the same amount of nutrition as eating 3 ounces of beef liver a week.</p><p>So how much vitamin A does desiccated liver contain? I am looking at the Oh Baby chart under the Vitamin A chapter and 3oz raw beef liver has 80,000IU! I'm confused how that is ok when the IU daily for a woman is 10,000? I think I'm just confused overall about the upper limits when actual food source contains more than that, and also where desiccated liver falls into the chart...</p>]]></message>

She regularly consumes organic dairy (cottage cheese, feta cheese, etc) and does not find any negative effects from eating those. I see on the Oh Baby Food Guide that it says to "be especially mindful (of consuming dairy products) if you have endometriosis". Can you explain to me why this is the case?

<message><![CDATA[<p>Hi Corina – excellent questions! Depending on the individual, coffee can present with either a diuretic or laxative effect. There are certain compounds contained in both caffeinated and decaffeinated coffee that influence the production of a hormone called gastrin. Gastrin promotes stomach contractions and relaxes the sphincters of the intestinal system, which can prompt a bowel movement. Other clients, in contrast, may find that coffee noticeably influences their constipation. For the purpose of your client trial, it would be helpful to include these insights as a gentle reminder for our evaluators.</p><p>If a client is desiring a similar taste to coffee, decaffeinated coffee can be an exceptionally supportive alternative. However, I would recommend proceeding forth with a ‘certified organic’ and/or ‘swiss water’ decaffeinated coffee as these extraction processes use carbon dioxide and water respectively, rather than chemical solvents that have been associated with neurological repercussions in higher concentrations. The decaffeination process also influences the antioxidant content of coffee so it may be advantageous to explore other warming beverages, like a homemade turmeric latte, depending on your client’s unique nutritional requirements and postpartum-related conditions. It's also important to note that the decaffeination process does not remove tannins from its beverages, so increased mindfulness is necessary for those presenting with anemia or low iron.</p>]]></message>

<message><![CDATA[<p>Absolutely! There is a growing body of literature that suggests a correlation between symptoms of endometriosis and dairy containing A1 casein. Most cow’s milk based products in North American grocers contain a combination of A1 and A2 beta-casein proteins, while other breeds, such as goat and sheep, exclusively contain A2 proteins. For many women, there does not seem to be a correlation between A2 casein and endometriosis symptoms; however, more research is ultimately needed for conclusive insights.</p><p>While we endeavor to include endometriosis in depth during our upcoming Fertility Nutrition course, Nicole Jardim remains an excellent source for endometriosis wisdom. It’s also wonderful to hear that your client is emphasizing organic sources as many of the hormone and inflammatory-related concerns revolve around conventional dairy products with additional hormones and antibiotics.</p>]]></message>

<message><![CDATA[<p>Not necessarily! It is possible for dairy-free clients to meet their daily requirements through different species of seaweed (or fish if supporting pescatarian-based clients). The best way to determine iodine requirements is through additional testing with their primary healthcare practitioner. However, you are absolutely correct in recognizing that excess iodine in circulation can contribute to adverse health impacts – most notably thyroid dysfunction and/or goiters. The tolerable upper intake for iodine is established at 1100 mcg daily for both pregnant and breastfeeding mothers. Many whole food and high-quality prenatal contain the daily requirement, with most women consuming some iodine-rich foods interspersed throughout the week. For mother’s diagnosed with hyperthyroidism, it is typically recommended to avoid iodine-rich foods and prioritize goitrogenic foods like cauliflower, Brussel sprouts, and so forth. Goitrogens are naturally occurring substances that block the absorption and utilization of iodine. These food sources should ideally be consumed raw as heat destroys their goitrogenic effect. In the case of hypothyroidism, an additional supplement or increase in iodine-rich foods may be necessary to explore. In such a case, it would be advantageous to collaboratively work with your client's primary healthcare practitioner to better support her unique requirements, especially if there are additional medications to consider.</p>]]></message>

<message><![CDATA[<p>Hi Natalie – thanks for checking-in with us! The folate source, derived from saccharomyces cerevisiae, would align most with a whole food source which is good; however, given your client’s known MTHFR genetic expression, it would be highly beneficial to recommend a methylated folate supplement, particularly if your client is in her first trimester. Unfortunately factors for converting folate into methylated forms have not yet been established when considering their respective dietary folate measurement. Furthermore, while folate-rich foods contain protective and synergistic cofactors that support the folate pathway, it is often difficult for those with genetic expressions to meet or complement their daily requirements through food sources alone.</p>]]></message>

<message><![CDATA[<p>Hi Erin – it is quite difficult to pinpoint the precise cause of acne as it is often multifactorial. However, as you mentioned, when acne is specifically related to pregnancy it is often reflective of hormonal imbalance. Generally speaking, recommendations for acne include fresh fruit, vegetables, antioxidant rich-foods, adequate water intake, fermented foods, along with anti-inflammatory omega 3 sources. It can also be beneficial to mindfully reduce dairy, fried foods, trans fats, and industrial seed oils to promote better hormonal balance in the body. The recommendations provided in the ‘Itching Protocol’ for liver support, additionally, would be helpful in balancing hormones and removing excess from the body.</p><p>In terms of side effects, we would recommend your client consult with their recommending practitioner to better understand the full range of potential side effects, as these can vary between companies.</p>]]></message>

<message><![CDATA[<p>That is correct – our personal insurance, for both consultations and the curriculum, restricts us and our students from recommending nutrient quantities above and beyond the government’s tolerable upper intake level. These guidelines will likely differ between practitioners, scope of practice, regulations, and so forth.</p><p>For clarification purposes, we typically recommend moderate consumption of organic, grass-fed beef liver which correlates to approximately 1 to 2-ounces or so per week. This cumulative amount can be grated into a bolognese sauce or chili and consumed in smaller quantities throughout the week. The precise quantity of liver capsules will vary between brands and species, so it is often best to consult with the manufacturer directly when considering your client’s specific nutrient requirements. I hope this helps to provide additional insight but please do not hesitate to reach out if something remains unclear.</p>]]></message>

<message><![CDATA[<p>Thanks so much, that's really helpful! I was going to recommend the Pink Stork folate supplement but this client is also taking the Baby &amp; Me 2 prenatal which contains 600mcg of methylated folate. Is it still advantageous for this client to take an additional methylated folate supplement like Pink Stork? Or is the prenatal enough? She is in her first trimester.</p>]]></message>

<message><![CDATA[<p>You are most welcome, and thanks for the additional supplement information! It's typically beneficial for client's with a known MTHFR mutation to supplement with 800 DFE in its methylated form. As folate is a water-soluble vitamin, and does not pose the same risk as folic acid, an additional supplement would be particularly supportive with mindfulness around the tolerable upper limit level established at 1000 mcg (includes both folic acid and folate unfortunately). There are a few paths that can be explored though: prioritize a separate prenatal multivitamin that meets the requirements during the first trimester and continue forth with the Baby &amp; Me 2 prenatal afterwards; complement the cumulative total with folate-rich food sources; or explore an additional supplement that remains under the tolerable upper limit level. Admittedly, folate can be a tricky nutrient to navigate but it does get easier with time!</p>]]></message>

<message><![CDATA[<p>Hello, my eczema baby client trial is 8.5 months and has a confirmed allergy to dairy and eggs (has had eczema since he was 2,5 months old). He had severe reaction to cheese (swollen and 2 nights in hospital). They have also introduced gluten as an allergen, but haven't introduced the others yet (no nuts, fish, soy). What's worrying me is that the mother said he has a weird reaction to meat - she tried chicken and turkey 3 times and every time he threw up. Main concern is that baby can't get all his nutrients considering he now has a limited diet (fruit, vegetables, grains and cereals), since mother is afraid to give him meat again. Have you encountered this reaction to meat before? Any suggestions on what I could recommend?</p>]]></message>

<message><![CDATA[<p>Hi Susanna – it's difficult for us to provide concrete guidance in this area as it remains so new and ultimately lacks the necessary research. In respect to zinc, it's important that CNC's remain mindful of its tolerable upper intake level established at 40 mg for breastfeeding mothers over the age of nineteen. Additionally, both <a href="https://journal-inflammation.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12950-021-00268-6" rel="nofollow noopener" title="https://journal-inflammation.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12950-021-00268-6">Quercetin</a> and <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7649937/" rel="nofollow noopener" title="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7649937/">NAC</a> have shown promising results, although we do not yet feel comfortable on recommending specific dosages for breastfeeding mothers.</p>]]></message>

This must be so frustrating for his parents to navigate.</p><p>Based on the information provided though, it sounds like this baby would be considered particularly high-risk for developing food allergies, which unfortunately remains outside the scope of practice for this client trial. It's possible that their baby is experiencing Food Protein-Induced Enterocolitis Syndrome caused by an allergic reaction to one or more ingested foods that inflame the small and large intestines. The primary medical treatment is strict avoidance, and while most children outgrow FPIES by age 3 or 4, reintroduction must be complete under doctor’s supervision.</p>]]></message>

<message><![CDATA[<p>For clarification purposes, FPIES is one of several possibilities behind baby's reaction to chicken and turkey, not an absolute certainty. Although fewer cases have been associated with breastfed babies, FPIES can arise during their introduction to solids. Nevertheless, it does remain outside a CNCs scope of practice to suggest if, when, and how potential allergenic triggers be reintroduced. For high-risk infants more generally, it is best for them to consult their healthcare practitioner, especially when introducing other allergenic sources like nuts, fish, and soy. When considering the eligibility of your next volunteer, please ensure that they meet the additional criterions under the header 'Considerations for the Food Sensitivities / Eczema ﻿Client Trial'. As always, if you have additional questions regarding your client trial or volunteer's eligibility, please reach out to us prior to conducting your consultation.</p><p>If supporting clients with known or suspected allergies upon graduation, it is important to consult with your insurance company to ensure that this type of support is covered under your CNC designation. Based in Canada, where we ultimately operate, our insurance does not personally cover us (or our students) to support high-risk babies with known or suspected allergies, without the guidance of an allergist or medical doctor. I hope this helps to provide further clarification but please let us know if anything remains unclear!</p>]]></message>

<message><![CDATA[<p>That is correct! Oftentimes when individuals begin their introduction to fermented foods, like kombucha, they dramatically increase the amount and diversity of beneficial strains entering into their microbiome. This can produce tummy rumbles and bloating; however, can be remedied by increasing their intake more gradually and/or diluting kombucha with water. Furthermore, as kombucha may contain caffeine, sugar, and alcohol, those with sensitivities may be more likely to experience digestive symptoms.</p>]]></message>

However, in summary, it would be helpful to encourage the consumption of fermented foods and high-potency probiotics, initiate breastfeeding as quickly as possible, and create space for early and prolonged skin-to-skin exposure. Studies have shown that the maternal consumption of fermented foods and probiotics can more than double the amount of immunoprotective compounds in their breast milk.</p>]]></message>

<message><![CDATA[<p>Hi Kerstin ‒ melatonin is a particularly fascinating hormone during pregnancy as an expectant mother’s ovaries and placenta typically produce higher concentrations at this time. However, there remains very limited research on how additional supplementation can contribute to adverse or beneficial impacts during pregnancy.<br>As melatonin levels typically rise approximately 2-hours before bedtime, it would be particularly supportive to recommend the avoidance or reduction of blue light-emitting devices, like computers or cellphones, to help neutralize the impact on your client’s natural circadian rhythm and melatonin production.</p>]]></message>

<message><![CDATA[<p>Hi Corina – we immensely appreciate your patience with our reply! While eczema is generally approached with topical creams, these remedies unfortunately do not address the underlying imbalances of the immune and digestive systems which we wholeheartedly believe deserves additional support and guidance. As presented in the curriculum, the introduction of highly allergenic foods between the ages of 6 to 12-months can decrease a baby's overall risk; informing their immune system to develop tolerance and protecting against overactive responses. It has been shown that two to three exposures, at minimum, will be effective in supporting baby’s tolerance to these highly allergenic sources. Due to the incredibly effective and efficient nature of the Gut Support Protocol, a known or suspected trigger only requires elimination for a few months, at most, before it can be re-introduced and supportive of reducing baby’s overall risk before 12-months of age. Also Solid Starts is an excellent resource and we look forward to your potential collaboration opportunities in the future!</p>]]></message>

<message><![CDATA[<p>Hi Lucie – with mindfulness around the tolerable upper limit intake, established at 45mg, iron repletion typically requires a more regulated dosage from an iron chelate and/or emphasis on heme-rich foods. Supplementation with desiccated liver capsules can be tricky to navigate as they frequently do not contain nutritional information on their respective labels, and their consistency can vary between batches and capsules. Due to this, it can be difficult to use them in cases such as anemia where a more regulated dose is preferred (and cumulative vitamin A quantity is considered). As each client’s nutritional requirements are so unique, it is difficult to say with absolute certainty if the Desiccated Spleen from Ancestral Supplements will be enough to replete their stores. However, it certainly can be beneficial to include as a secondary supplement. Please also be mindful that CNCs are not permitted to ‘prevent’ or ‘treat’ any condition or disease (i.e. anemia). Instead, we encourage the utilization of words like ‘support’, ‘improve’, or ‘reduce the likelihood of’.</p>]]></message>

<message><![CDATA[<p>Hi team, one question with regards to iron supplementation. In Switzerland it's quite common doctors prescribe Maltofer in case of low iron/ferritin levels or anemia. Since my postpartum client trial takes these iron supplements as well, I researched a bit to see what the active substance is. I discovered it's iron(III) hydroxide polymaltose and read a few studies that mention a similar efficacy to ferrous sulfate (that's what most studies are about), but it's generally more accepted by patients and better tolerated. One study (<a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21859366/)" rel="nofollow noopener" title="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21859366/)">https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih...</a> says "Oral iron(III) polymaltose complex offers at least equivalent efficacy and a superior safety profile compared to ferrous sulfate for the treatment of iron-deficiency anemia during pregnancy." But I haven't really found much on its level of bioavailability. Also, the supplements usually have quite some preservatives: E217, E219, flavorings: sucrose, vanillin and other additives.</p><p>Have you encountered this  iron form before? It's not captured in the curriculum so thought I might ask. Not sure if I should recommend changing them to my client, she said she hasn't noticed any side effects...</p><p>Thanks a lot!</p>]]></message>

<message><![CDATA[<p>Hi Corina – we love that you delved into the academic literature available for this nutrient complex! Iron polymaltose is a combination of ferric iron with maltol. Maltol is a food additive used primarily as a flavor enhancer and would unfortunately not align with an ideal chelated form of iron. I would prefer if this supplement did not contain artificial flavor, preservatives (as you mentioned), sorbitol, and would advise against the consumption of ethanol during pregnancy and while breastfeeding. However, there is no need to concern your client with this information if she is currently supplementing with Maltofer and is not experiencing adverse side effects. It is likely safe with the limited research that we have available, though we would not personally recommend this supplement.</p>]]></message>

<message><![CDATA[<p>I'm a bit confused, for the example of the 'one a day' #1 ob/gyn recommended brand. It says one of the reasons it's not recommended is because it contains numerous different artificial dyes but when looking at the ingredients I just see -&gt; color (annatto extract [seed]) which is a natural coloring as mentioned in the foundational nutrition module. Then when looking at the supplement facts, it lists Folate 1330 mcg DFE. It does say 800 mcg folic acid but when someone for example is looking for a prenatal that cost is a big factor for, this one seems ideal because it lists folate on it. Is this just a marketing thing or is this way of listing folate ok? It's confusing when it lists both haha. Thanks!</p>]]></message>

<message><![CDATA[<p>Hi Breann ‒ the FDA created the Dietary Folate Equivalent (DFE) measurement to facilitate consistency in measuring the quantity of folate across different food and supplement sources. With supplement fact labels, the DFE measurement will be listed first, followed by its specific nutrient form in parentheses (confirmed in the list of ingredients as folic acid). Admittedly, folate can be a difficult nutrient to navigate but it will get easier with time! In respect to artificial dyes, it appears that the manufacturer recently changed their formula as it previously included FD&amp;C Red #40 Dye, Red #40 Lake, and Yellow #6 Lake. We will be sure to make the necessary changes, thanks!</p>]]></message>

It can be quite surprising how much babies eat, especially in the midst of a growth spurt or while teething, as the act of chewing can be particularly helpful in soothing sore gums. I would also recommend mindfulness around: ensuring ample sources of protein and fat to increase baby's satiation at each meal; offering food until baby expresses signs of satiation; and considering the possibility that baby is receiving something in the highchair that they otherwise might not (i.e. parent’s undivided attention). If concerns persist beyond these considerations, I would recommend proceeding forth with their primary healthcare practitioner.</p>]]></message>

<message><![CDATA[<p>Hi Mariana ‒ excellent questions! Unlike celiac disease, gluten will not damage the intestines, but it can contribute to unpleasant symptoms like flatulence, nausea, abdominal pain, unclear thinking, and/or eczema in those experiencing imbalances within their digestive and immune systems. We will delve into this more precisely during Module 4 of Baby Nutrition.</p><p>Nevertheless, it is important to emphasize that the introduction of gluten around 10-months of age will help baby’s immune system to develop tolerance and reduce the likelihood of an overactive response. For most individuals, gluten grains are not typically concerning; however, it is important to remain mindful of processed foods that contain gluten in addition to chemicals, preservatives, colorings, and/or additives as these can lead to adverse health affects.</p>]]></message>

<message><![CDATA[<p>Hi Team, just a question on eczema. <br>If a baby's eczema appeared before the baby started solids, is it likely something the breastfeeding mama is eating that is causing the flare up or would you consider it more likely something environmental? The flare ups were very occasional but have since resolved themselves a few months after baby started solids. Baby's mum did a heap of moisturising every day and a colder bath but other than that, nothing particularly fancy. This isn't linked to my client trial, it was just a conversation I had with another mum that got me wondering about it and the reason it came for a few months but then disappeared on its own without an elimination diet or gut support protocol. Did the baby simply just grow out of it?</p>]]></message>

<message><![CDATA[<p>Generally speaking, I would be inclined to follow baby’s hunger cues while offering nutrient-dense foods and continuing forth with breast / formula feeds. Often our modern day society is quite hypervigilant around charts and numbers when babies fall on either end of the ‘healthy weight’ spectrum. In the case of excessive weight loss though, it would be advised to include foods like nut butters (if mindfully and successfully introduced) and coconut products. While eating healthy fats does not necessarily equate to additional body fat, as a macronutrient, fat has higher calories per gram than other macronutrients. And we want to ensure there is sufficient caloric intake, with mindfulness around baby’s hunger cues and balanced meals, to better support baby's optimal weight at this time. If concerns persist; however, we would recommend proceeding forth with their primary healthcare practitioner.</p>]]></message>

<message><![CDATA[<p>Generally speaking, if baby is observed to have a strong gag, their natural inclination would be to vomit as a means to clear food from their passageway. However, babies tend to remain unfazed by these events and will continue forth with eating as nothing ever happened. It will noticeably be correlated to their gag reflex. If the vomiting was associated with the timeline of a food allergy, it would likely be correlated to the introduction of an allergenic source, lead to more severe vomiting, and change baby’s disposition. Vomiting also typically accompanies additional symptoms like hives or swelling, which would help to communicate this as a symptom of allergy. If ever uncertain or unclear, we would recommend that future client's consult with their primary healthcare practitioner, especially in the case of high-risk babies.</p>]]></message>

<message><![CDATA[<p>It’s difficult to say with absolute certainty. When baby’s develop eczema before their introduction to solids, it is often indicative of a need for additional gut support. However, it is possible that upon the introduction of solids, baby was offered gut supporting foods (i.e. bone broth, fermented foods, easily digestible and anti-inflammatory vegetables) that indirectly supported the root cause of baby’s eczema.</p>]]></message>

<message><![CDATA[<p>Hello, I don't see it mentioned in the pregnancy module, but from my understanding yeast infections can be quite common during pregnancy. I know someone who had yeast infections in both of her pregnancies so it got me thinking more about. In the case of the person I know, she was already following a nutrient dense diet. I feel like gut health would have an important role to play with yeast infections, so perhaps a greater importance on probiotics? I'm wondering if there are any recommendations for this during pregnancy. Thank you!</p>]]></message>

<message><![CDATA[<p>Hi Lindsey – excellent question! Generally speaking, yeast thrives in a sugar-rich environment, so it would be helpful to recommend that client’s drastically reduce their intake of sugar, refined carbohydrates, alcohol (if applicable), tropical / dried fruits, juice, and natural sweeteners along with white vinegar, peanuts, and dairy which can further exacerbate imbalance between symbiotic and pathogenic bacteria at this time. Probiotics, as you mentioned, would be immensely beneficial to help inhibit the growth of sugar-fermenting yeast, particularly of the lactobacillus strains. Coconut products, in addition, contain antifungal agents, lauric, and caprylic acids which would help to reduce the likelihood of yeast infections when complimented by a nutrient-dense diet.</p>]]></message>

<message><![CDATA[<p>This can be a tricky answer to navigate as active vitamin A is typically sourced from animals (i.e. fish liver) or in its synthetic form (i.e. retinyl palmitate or retinyl acetate). The ester forms of retinol should ideally be avoided during pregnancy; however, there are certain circumstances, such as strictly plant-based mothers, who may require synthetic vitamin A with increased mindfulness around remaining under the tolerable upper intake limit established at 3000mcg RAE or 10,000IU. As always, we would recommend a food-first approach, rather than additional supplementation, whenever possible.</p><p>In respect to iron, this will ultimately depend upon the client’s unique health context. For instance, if your client is consuming ample sources of heme iron, additional supplementation may not be necessary. However, if they have been diagnosed with pregnancy-related anemia, a higher concentration of supplemental iron may be recommended by their healthcare practitioner. As a CNC, it is important to remain mindful of the tolerable upper limit intake established at 45mg daily for iron.</p>]]></message>

<message><![CDATA[<p>Hi team. When talking about several important nutrients for babies some of the richest sources of foods in these nutrients are allergens (fish, dairy) and are therefore recommended to be introduced later than 6 months. When conducting the starting solids client trial, we need to provide 2 food sources for all important nutrients and often it's either fish or dairy. For iron and choline it's clear because meat is not an allergen and egg yolk can be introduced with 6 months already. But with D3, omega 3, calcium, for example, should we still recommend the richest food sources (fish and dairy) and also include the fact that it's recommended to wait until they're introduced? I know that mentioning 2 other foods that aren't allergens and can be safely introduced at 6 months is an option, but it feels a bit more short term looking (since they're not the richest sources of these nutrients). Thanks!</p>]]></message>

<message><![CDATA[<p>Thanks for the clarification, Breann! This will depend on your client’s preferences and unfortunately does not have a universal answer. Generally speaking, we would emphasize whole food sources before considering additional supplementation based on your client's diet, supplemental rhythms, and motivations. However, it is important to remain mindful that the ‘mcg RAE’ unit of measurement already accounts for the way different components of vitamin A, like beta-carotene, convert into retinol at different rates. As such, it is possible for beta-carotene sources to meet a client’s daily requirements if measured in ‘mcg RAE’. In respect to liver capsules, it would be beneficial to contact the manufacturer directly as the nutrient profiles can vary between batches and capsules. Having said this, they do not typically contain high quantities of iron, although certainly do provide a nutritional boost. I would also recommend mindfulness around your client’s motivations for following a vegan-based lifestyle as grass-fed liver capsules may not be the most supportive option for them. Instead, synthetic vitamin A or an emphasis on beta-carotene-rich foods may be necessary.</p>]]></message>

<message><![CDATA[<p>Hi! My postpartum client offers both breastfeeding and formula-feeding to her baby and her experience has been very empowering without any complications. This is why besides recommending her skin to skin, and giving some recommendations on how to properly store breastmilk, I am struggling to complete the feeding support part of our client trial. Do you have any other general suggestions that may help? Thanks!</p>]]></message>

<message><![CDATA[<p>Hi Monica – I believe this sentence was misinterpreted as it does affirm the importance of supplementing with probiotics following antibiotic therapy in early pregnancy, rather than waiting to increase their respective intake in the third trimester when preparing the vaginal canal for birth. This section highlights the significance of each client's unique health requirements, as their needs may not always align with the trimester of "most" importance.</p>]]></message>

<message><![CDATA[<p>Generally speaking, multivitamins are not necessary for the majority of toddlers. At this age, whole foods and breast milk or formula consumption provide them with the most bioavailable source of nutrients. That is why we encourage the continuation of breast milk or formula until 12-months, and then only to discontinue, if desired, when the child is reliably consuming 3-meals and snacks that are well-balanced and nutrient-dense. Of course, multivitamins may be recommended depending on a few factors, such as if there are dietary restrictions, if the child is raised plant-based, if growth and development are not on track, etc.</p>]]></message>

<message><![CDATA[<p>That is correct. If the client's prenatal is solely derived from whole foods, an additional methylated folate supplement would be highly beneficial. However, it would be recommended to remain within the 600 to 800 DFE measurement range, rather than larger quantities of 1mg, 5mg, or 15mg.</p>]]></message>

<message><![CDATA[<p>Thank you this was very helpful! So, if a supplement has less than 770mcg RAE, we should recommend vitamin A foods such as liver, eggs, butter, sweet potatoes, carrots, pumpkin etc. but how do we know how beta carotene food sources that are measured in mg's, convert to IU so they aren't getting too much and going over the upper tolerable intake? Or this this not a thing with beta carotene food sources?</p>]]></message>

<message><![CDATA[<p>Hi Maria ‒ thanks for your patience with our response! As the tolerable upper limit intake is established at 1000mcg for vitamin B9, this dosage would typically align best for those with a known MTHFR genetic expression who do not regularly consume folate-rich foods like grass-fed chicken liver or lentils. It would also be ideal for this supplement to include fewer excipients overall.</p>]]></message>

<message><![CDATA[<p>Hi Mariana ‒ generally speaking, the absorbability of nutrients is not something to be particularly concerned with. This holds especially true for client’s who are not presenting with significant nutrient deficiencies. In the case that a client is diagnosed with anemia, for example, it can be helpful to recommend the separation of these supplements, iron and magnesium included, by at least 2-hours. We will delve into specific nutrient considerations, like zinc, during your core courses. However, supplementation is typically not required as long as your client is consuming zinc-rich foods, utilizing proper preparation methods, and/or complementing their diet with a prenatal multivitamin. Zinc absorption is most notably influenced by phytic acid and other anti-nutritional factors.</p>]]></message>

<message><![CDATA[<p>Hi Sylviamaria – iron supplementation is a very delicate topic to navigate and typically not an area that CNCs would support without the guidance of a client’s family medical doctor. An additional challenge arises when anemia is of concern as oftentimes babies, and even adults, will require more iron than the recommended dietary allowance which CNCs are unfortunately unable to recommend above. The best recommendation would be to ask if their family medical doctor would be comfortable trying another brand and/or consult with a naturopathic doctor for further options. It can also be quite difficult to source a baby-friendly iron supplement without additional or unwanted additives.</p><p>In terms of probiotics, we generally recommend the Infant Probiotic Powder from Smidge (newborns) or Klaire Labs Ther-Biotic Infant Formula (for those 6-months and above), while a combined supplement like Nordic Naturals DHA (based on baby's body weight) would help satisfy their vitamin D3 and omega 3 requirements. I hope this helps to empower you with a few high-quality supplement recommendations! As you mentioned, our ultimate intention is to find whole food sources, rather than emphasizing long-term supplementation when possible.</p>]]></message>

<message><![CDATA[<p>Hi Priyanka ‒ we delve into plant-based sources further during Module 4 of Baby Nutrition. However, similarly to bone broth, there are additional glutamine-rich foods like sauerkraut, beets, and spinach that aid in digestion and immunity. In respect to complimentary beverages, non-caffeinated herbal teas and coconut, nut, or seed milks can be incredibly supportive recommendations with mindfulness around allergenic introductions. It is also important to emphasize that breast milk and/or formula consumption remains baby's primary source of nourishment until 12-months of age.</p>]]></message>

<message><![CDATA[<p>Fat-soluble vitamins, like D3 and K2, would require an additional source of fat for optimal absorption. This may be in the form of a carrier oil and/or alongside the consumption of foods containing fat. In respect to iodine, it would be best to contact the manufacturer directly as the ConcenTrace® nutritional label does not communicate the inclusion of iodine. Furthermore, the iodine-specific supplement from Trace Minerals appears to have added potassium iodine which may suggest that the concentrated sea water is not particularly rich in this specific trace mineral. This may vary between trace mineral sources and companies; however, individual assessment would be necessary.</p>]]></message>

<message><![CDATA[<p>Hello, my client is very low in iron, borderline anaemic, she was previously taking Thorne iron bisglycinate (25mg of elemental iron) as it's the preferred source, she was advised to take 2 x capsules per day but they made her feel nauseous. Instead she was prescribed iron polymaltose (100mg of elemental iron) by her doctor, which is available from the local pharmacy in Australia. I don't believe polymaltose was mentioned in this course. Do you have any advice on this source and if she should swap away from Thorne in order to increase her levels? In addition, she takes Foraged for You daily which contains grass-fed beef liver. Thanks in advance, Erin</p>]]></message>

<message><![CDATA[<p>Hi Priyanka – it is recommended for 11-month-old babies to consume between 2 to 4 bottles daily, with an average serving size of 6 to 8-ounces. As formula is supplemental, there are no beverage alternatives to meet baby’s nutritional requirements at this age. If baby is adverse to formula milk, it may be beneficial to explore the possibility of a nursing strike or additional vessel to consume liquid from. Perhaps baby would be more receptive of formula from a supplemental nursing system if the breast is preferred? Having said this, I would recommend mindfulness around the eligibility requirements of your Starting Solids (i.e. baby between the ages of 4 to 6-months) and Food Sensitivities / Eczema volunteers (additional considerations included). Based on the information provided, it is unclear if your volunteer would align with either client trial requirements.</p>]]></message>

<message><![CDATA[<p>Hi Jane – we certainly empathize with your desire for clarification and want you to feel empowered when communicating this information. Although newer research has shown the development of a “closed-circuit” digestive system within baby's first month, it does takes time for their digestive system to mature and efficiently assimilate nutrients from solids. The increased risk of a premature introduction is in relation to food sensitivities and eczema, rather than allergies themselves, as both point to excess intestinal permeability.</p>]]></message>

<message><![CDATA[<p>Hi Jane, we’re happy to provide further clarification and will update the curriculum soon to better reflect these points below:</p><p>– Every time an allergic baby comes into contact with an allergen, they will experience an allergic reaction internally, regardless of whether symptoms present externally.</p><p>– Sometimes an allergic person may be able to eat small amounts of a problematic food without symptoms presenting.</p><p>The vast majority of immune systems will present with allergic symptomatology upon exposure to the offending protein; however, it is possible for some individuals to develop tolerance in controlled environments through allergen immunotherapy or allergic desensitization. As such, some individuals may tolerate small amounts of a problematic food, although more conclusive research is needed to better understand its overall effectiveness. There is also potential for some children to outgrow their allergies as their bodies and immune systems mature.</p>]]></message>

<message><![CDATA[<p>Iron polymaltose is a combination of ferric iron with maltol – a food additive used primarily as a flavor enhancer. Maltofer is the most commonly recommended supplement and it contains artificial flavors, preservatives, sorbitol, and ethanol which would be ideal to avoid during pregnancy and/or breastfeeding. However, there is no need to concern your client with this information if she is currently supplementing with Maltofer and is not experiencing adverse side effects. It is likely safe with the limited research that we have available, though we would not personally recommend this supplement. As the cumulative intake of iron exceeds the tolerable upper intake level of 45mg (which CNCs are not permitted to recommend above), any supplemental changes would need to be discussed with her primary healthcare practitioner. In respect to her iron bisglycinate supplement, I am curious if she frequently consumed this on an empty stomach? Although iron is best absorbed on an empty stomach, it can contribute to nausea in some individuals when not consumed with a little bit of food (remaining mindful of tannin-rich beverages, calcium, and anti-nutritional factors).</p>]]></message>

<message><![CDATA[<p>Hi Janine, I am happy to share Carley’s thoughts about this procedure! It is true that frenotomy is becoming increasingly common, and anecdotally, many parents, specifically breastfeeding mothers, have experienced relief through improved latch and other benefits.</p><p>When creating the Oh Baby curriculum, Carley felt that it was important to address the other side of frenotomy. When we have something that dramatically increases in popularity, we often are presented with positive outcomes only. In doing so, some families may feel that their decision was not fully informed. Although this stance may be overly prudent, it is important that families individually assess the risks and benefits themselves. She admits that the tone of this lesson may not have been as celebratory, but at the heart of her decision, it was important that both sides be represented and in no means questions the positive experiences of those who have undergone frenotomy.</p>]]></message>

<message><![CDATA[<p>Hi Shjarn, thanks for checking with us! As mentioned in the client trial guidelines, we encourage students to acknowledge conditions and medications outside of a CNCs scope by stating something along the lines of “I am not well versed in fertility and Letrozole myself, so please modify my recommendations to best suit your needs and speak directly with your healthcare practitioner before implementing anything that we discuss.” This client trial has ultimately been designed to help practice your skills and implement the knowledge that you have gained from Foundational Nutrition. You are not expected to address supplements and medications in depth but rather provide general recommendations on how to choose high-quality supplements.</p>]]></message>

<message><![CDATA[<p>You are most welcome! As this supplement is practitioner-prescribed, and both supplement quantities exceed what a CNC can recommend, it is important that your client consult her primary healthcare practitioner before implementing any supplemental changes. Perhaps a single capsule of iron bisglycinate, with mindfulness around iron-rich foods, would better support her experiences with nausea. Supplementation with desiccated liver capsules can be tricky to navigate as they frequently do not contain nutritional information on their respective labels, and their consistency can vary between batches and capsules. Due to this, it can be difficult to use them in cases such as anemia where a more regulated dose is preferred (and cumulative vitamin A quantity is considered).</p>]]></message>

<message><![CDATA[<p>Hi I am wondering, when reintroducing a certain food group like dairy or gluten (after eliminating) is there a ladder of food to reintroduce first? I have heard of a dairy ladder but personally didn't love the types of food that are suggested to be given such as processed biscuits with milk 'baked' in. My son is now 5 and we have had such a journey with food sensitivities. I have always struggled to find sound advice to follow. Lots of contradicting advice so I have been left to research on my own quite a bit. We have done elimination diets through a dietician specialising in allergies. I stopped that after some time as all we were doing was stripping his diet down to white foods and his symptoms were almost worse not better. Our naturopath had actually suggested the histamine intolerance and suggested supplementing with a glutamine powder which we did. He currently takes probiotics and we used digestive enzymes in the past but not at the moment. We now just avoid dairy and wheat with the exception of organic butter. I have been lost as to how to reintroduce these foods and now after reading module 4 I feel more confident, but just not sure what foods and how much to start with. Do you have some suggestions ? As I have lived this I know that would be a question that would be asked by a client so I just wish to be prepared. I also think having firsts hand experience with going through the protocol would give me a depth of knowledge with my clients too.</p>]]></message>

<message><![CDATA[<p>Hi Kayla! As you mentioned, the precise nutrient quantities will vary widely between homemade batches and companies so it would be best to consider bone broth as a nutritional boost, rather than providing precise amounts of micronutrients like iron or vitamin A. We also prefer to emphasize the benefits of other nutrients, like collagen and glycine, when considering its nutritional importance, especially during the postpartum period.</p>]]></message>

<message><![CDATA[<p>As mentioned in the CPS article, there unfortunately remains no international consensus regarding how to define infants at high-risk for developing food allergies. In respect to Oh Baby’s assessment of high-risk babies, a family history of food allergies has been shown to increase an infant’s risk in developing similar food allergies. Furthermore, research has shown a correlation between asthma and the development of food allergies which is ultimately why both factors have been included in our assessment for high-risk babies. The natural progression of allergic diseases can include hay fever, which typically accompanies food allergies, asthma, and/or eczema that would factor into baby's risk assessment. As celiac disease is not associated with food allergies or intolerances, the autoimmune condition is not considered an individual risk factor. I hope this helps to provide additional clarification, but please do not hesitate to reach out if something remains unclear.</p>]]></message>

<message><![CDATA[<p>Thank you for this reply! I did contact the manufacturer, and they confirmed an amount of 1,500 mg RAE... interestingly, I was looking at the label from a website to purchase, and it showed a different label than the actual website itself from the manufacturer. Lesson learned right there! Thanks again.</p>]]></message>

<message><![CDATA[<p>Hi Olivie ‒ excellent question! It ultimately comes down to what resonates best with your client. While many mothers feel that they benefit from consuming their placenta, there are others that do not respond as positively. It is a subject that we personally do not advise on as it is highly controversial and there unfortunately remains minimal scientific literature to provide proper recommendations.</p>]]></message>

<message><![CDATA[<p>Hi Olivie – it would be best for this client to consult with their primary healthcare practitioner and undergo additional blood work. Deficiencies in certain nutrients, like iron, vitamins C, and K can increase one’s susceptibility to bruising. Their primary healthcare practitioner can also rule out possibilities like medication side-effects, bleeding disorders, thyroid conditions, and/or repetitive bumps from carrying the car seat.</p>]]></message>

<message><![CDATA[<p>If a mother suspects dairy as a potential trigger, and felt it was not too strenuous, she could certainly proceed forth with a mindful elimination diet of dairy, while supporting baby's digestive and immune systems. It is absolutely possible to meet her calcium requirements through other calcium-rich foods, and when complimented by a prenatal multivitamin when breastfeeding.</p><p>As a gentle reminder, our small team unfortunately does not have the capacity to support graduates beyond their client trial volunteers.

For my client trial, I am preparing to recommend calcium supplementation in her protocol, as she is consuming roughly 500mg a day, of the 1,300mg RDA, and does not consume dairy. She just had bloodwork done and told me her calcium is "good". Should I be asking what levels her calcium is at? What would be a "good" level from bloodwork? Would I then be suggested not to recommend her a supplement, and keep encouraging foods high in calcium?</p>]]></message>

<message><![CDATA[<p>Generally speaking, there will be a “range of normal” for each test selected. This will be the most accurate method of gauging results without the support of a holistic practitioner who may feel ‘normal ranges’ do not necessarily equate to ‘optimal ranges’. The reference ranges can differ between countries, but for Canada specifically, laboratory values can be accessed <a href="https://mcc.ca/objectives/normal-values/?cn-reloaded=1" rel="nofollow noopener" title="https://mcc.ca/objectives/normal-values/?cn-reloaded=1">here</a>. As excess calcium in circulation can contribute to adverse health effects, it would be beneficial to emphasize a whole foods approach in light of your client’s recent blood panel.</p>]]></message>

<message><![CDATA[<p>Hello, I have come across a Canadian prenatal supplement called Bird &amp; Be. Reviewing the label and the modules, it appears to be a fairly well-rounded pre-natal and most of the forms of the vitamins and minerals are in the bioavailable form, and meeting the recommended daily requirements. However, vitamin C is in the form of ascorbic acid, and I noticed that the amount of magnesium is very low (also in the form of magnesium citrate which could upset some). They do market their products as vegan, but it seems like it would be suitable for non-vegans as well. I do find it interesting though that as marketing their products as vegan, I don't see vitamin K2, which is a nutrient that is recommended to supplement if following a strictly plant-based diet. All that said, I understand through the module that no prenatal is perfect. This seems to be a fairly good product from what I can tell. I'm wondering if I could get some feedback and if there are any immediate concerns that you would have if a client were taking this. They offer both a regular prenatal and what they have marketed as a Power Prenatal, which offers a few other nutrients. They also offer supplements for men to help aide in conception preparation, which is nice to see as this seems to be not often talked about, despite the fact that 40-50% of infertility cases, are due to male factor. I've included links below. Thanks!<br>Prenatal - <a href="https://birdandbe.com/prenatal-eggs/" rel="nofollow noopener" title="https://birdandbe.com/prenatal-eggs/">https://birdandbe.com/prena...</a><br>Power Prenatal - <a href="https://birdandbe.com/the-power-prenatal-for-eggs/" rel="nofollow noopener" title="https://birdandbe.com/the-power-prenatal-for-eggs/">https://birdandbe.com/the-p...</a></p>]]></message>

<message><![CDATA[<p>Hello, I am preparing for my client trial and my client said she is worried about her protein intake and wanted orientation towards taking whey protein. She also wanted to know about intermittent fasting and breastfeeding. I would think that since breastfeeding is a time where you have such high nutrient and calories needs, that intermittent fasting, just as a diet restricting calories wouldn't be ideal. I was wondering whether it could also influence milk supply?<br>Regarding whey, I did not receive her food journal yet, but I think consuming more protein rich foods would be preferable, since they also contain the necessary micronutrients instead of whey protein. But if she wants to supplement protein, what could I suggest?<br>Thanks!</p>]]></message>

<message><![CDATA[<p>Hi Katinka – best wishes on your upcoming client trial!</p><p>In truth, we are not huge advocates for whey protein as it tends to contribute gastrointestinal symptoms like bloating, flatulence, constipation, and/or loose stools even in those who tolerate dairy quite well. Although whole food sources are always preferred, we recognize the concern around protein requirements and would recommend gentle alternatives like collagen powder, hemp protein, or rotating between them both.</p><p>In regards to intermittent fasting, there unfortunately is very little scientific literature on lactation specifically. Ultimately the postpartum period is incredibly taxing on a woman’s body, and there simply is not enough evidence to suggest that intermittent fasting would be beneficial during a time when micronutrient and caloric needs are at their highest, as you mentioned. It would be best for this client to consult on intermittent fasting with their primary healthcare practitioner as it may not be supportive of their individual health context (i.e. those with diabetes or blood glucose irregularities, history of eating disorders, those under the age of eighteen, and so forth). Generally speaking, intermittent fasting is not recommended during pregnancy or lactation.</p>]]></message>

<message><![CDATA[<p>Hi Corina – this can be an easy topic to get wrapped into! Generally speaking, the absorbability of nutrients is not something to be notably concerned with. This holds especially true for client’s that do not present with significant nutrient deficiencies. In the case that a client is diagnosed with anemia, for example, it can be helpful to separate iron and calcium-rich foods with mindfulness around strategies to improve iron absorption. However, each client is so unique in their health context and genetic composition that it would be difficult to generalize these recommendations. We also encourage mindfulness if sharing this information with client's so that it does not become all-consuming or removes their enjoyment from eating (i.e. consuming meat and dairy separately on a continuous basis).</p>]]></message>

<message><![CDATA[<p>Hi Morgan – we immensely appreciate your patience with our reply! It is wonderful to hear that your confidence has grown in this realm following all of your independent research. The OBA Team has experienced tremendous success with implementing the Gut Support Protocol in their own families. We sincerely hope it helps with your son's journey as well!</p><p>It would be best to introduce dairy and/or gluten in a similar manner to solids. For instance, ghee (and butter) are often well tolerated because they are higher in fat, lower in lactose, and contain only trace amounts of milk proteins. Once tolerating these foods, fermented sources like milk kefir or yogurt, can then be introduced and monitored for a reaction. As pasteurized cow’s milk products are typically the most difficult to digest, it is best to delay their reintroduction until tolerating other sources.</p>]]></message>

<message><![CDATA[<p>Hi Lindsey, this was an excellent investigation into the Bird&amp;Be prenatal multivitamins! Our initial concern with these formulas is that it contains 400mcg of folic acid which can block the body's receptors for methylated folate. Furthermore, due to the prevalence of conversion issues that influence the utilization of folic acid, it would be ideal for women in their first trimester to supplement with a different prenatal multivitamin in supporting neural tube formations. Zinc citrate and calcium citrate are also more difficult for the body to assimilate, which can contribute to gastrointestinal repercussions and may not be the most supportive for those experiencing constipation, nausea, and/or vomiting. Having said this, we do deeply appreciate the emphasis on other methylated nutrients and schizochytrium.</p><p>As you mentioned, the perfect prenatal simply does not exist. The Bird&amp;Be supplement may be supportive for certain client’s with mindfulness around the above considerations.</p>]]></message>

<message><![CDATA[<p>I have been in such a conflict of trying to figure out what is what when it comes to vitamin D, particularly from what I have been learning/reading from toxicologist Ashley Everly and her research on the topic. I'd love Carley or the team's thoughts on this, particularly when it comes to supplementation for baby. I honestly have been holding off on vitamin d myself right now just from what I have been reading, but I wonder if it would be best for mothers to try and get the 1,25D blood test instead of 25D? It seems there is more research on this to be done. Linking two Facebook posts here where she explains her reasoning. It seems that many people are told they are vitamin d deficient based on the non-active blood test. <a href="https://www.facebook.com/ashleyeverlyvax/posts/4689765984378334" rel="nofollow noopener" title="https://www.facebook.com/ashleyeverlyvax/posts/4689765984378334">https://www.facebook.com/as...</a></p><p><a href="https://www.facebook.com/ashleyeverlyvax/posts/4301830083171928" rel="nofollow noopener" title="https://www.facebook.com/ashleyeverlyvax/posts/4301830083171928">https://www.facebook.com/as...</a></p>]]></message>

<message><![CDATA[<p>You are most welcome! In regards to your first volunteer, it unfortunately remains unclear if their family requires support with developmental readiness or choosing a feeding method. If this family expresses a desire to explore feeding methods, then you can proceed forth with this volunteer while ensuring that each section of your written client trial is sufficiently addressed. As always, we do encourage you to acknowledge conditions outside of your scope by telling client’s something along the lines of “I am not well versed in congenital CMV myself, so please modify my recommendation to best suit your needs and/or speak with your healthcare practitioner before implementing anything that we discuss.” Most babies with congenital CMV do not experience symptoms or conditions; however, each case is very unique and would be best supported by their primary healthcare practitioner.</p><p>When baby’s develop food sensitivities or allergies before their introduction to solids, it is often indicative of a need for gut support and will likely worsen as baby explores allergens throughout their introduction to solids. If the timeline of baby’s reaction aligns with a food sensitivity, rather than the results themselves, your third client would be appropriate to support in your personal consultation practice. However, as mentioned in the client trial considerations, the elimination diet must be conducted directly through the baby. As this baby has not yet been introduced to these allergenic sources, another volunteer would be required unfortunately.</p>]]></message>

<message><![CDATA[<p>Hello, I had a question about the client trials and I'm not quite sure where to post it. I have received the 3 day food journal, participation form and health intake form from my volunteer client. The main pregnancy related concern my client has is that she was diagnosed with perinatal anxiety and depression. I feel like this is out of our scope as a nutrition consultant, but I think there are ways that I can still support her and make recommendations. I know it's important to balance blood sugar, avoid caffeine, refined sugar and refined carbohydrates. Magnesium is also beneficial which she is taking a bioavailable form of. My client is already balancing her meals well, not consuming caffeine or refined sugar. Is it still ok if I when we meet for our session to bring up these points and provide some information, or would you advise us not to? She is taking some tinctures and herbal teas to help, and I will also ask about exercise and provide some lifestyle recommendations such as meditation. I'm just wondering if I'm on the right track and if in this situation it would be ok for me to make such recommendations. Thank you in advance!</p>]]></message>

<message><![CDATA[<p>Hi Lindsey – thanks for checking with us! The discussion board located under the 'Pregnancy Nutrition Client Trials' module is an excellent place to address questions or concerns relating to your client trials.</p><p>For clarification purposes, has this volunteer been chosen for your General Nutrition or Pregnancy Conditions client trial? If chosen for your Pregnancy Conditions client trial, it is important to ensure that your volunteer requires support with at least two pregnancy-related conditions discussed in Module 3 of Pregnancy Nutrition. These client trials have ultimately been designed to help practice your skills and implement the knowledge that you have gained from the Pregnancy Nutrition course. When supporting conditions (or tinctures) outside of a CNCs scope of practice, we encourage our students to say something along the lines of, “I am not well versed in perinatal anxiety and depression myself, so please modify my recommendations to best suit your needs and speak directly with your healthcare practitioner before implementing anything that we discuss.” We hope this helps to provide further clarification, but please do not hesitate to reach out if further questions arise. During the Postpartum Nutrition course, we will be delving into considerations and recommendations supportive of PPD / PPA, which can be applied to perinatal anxiety and depression in your personal consultation practice.</p>]]></message>

<message><![CDATA[<p>Hi Kayla, excellent questions! While maca is popular for preconception and postpartum, there unfortunately have not been any scientific studies on the potential side effects or birth outcomes during pregnancy. Most practitioners advise against supplementing with maca during pregnancy for this reason. We address the topic of adaptogens during Modules 3 and 4 of Postpartum Nutrition. Gelatinized maca powder can be a tremendously beneficial addition for breastfeeding mothers requiring support with energy, mood, and/or resilience to stress, in addition to regulating and balancing hormones while breastfeeding. We typically encourage breastfeeding mothers to utilize 1 to 2 tsp daily of gelatinized maca powder if requiring additional support.</p>]]></message>

<message><![CDATA[<p>Is your client’s meat aversion associated with nausea? If so, I would recommend reviewing the Nausea Protocol from Module Three. Without providing specific answers, it would be helpful to ensure ample plant-based proteins, while utilizing strategies to improve nutrient absorption and digestibility. Often hot foods are more pungent than cooler foods, so perhaps cooler forms would be more supportive as well.</p>]]></message>

<message><![CDATA[<p>Hello, <br>I have a question regarding a cod liver oil. This product seems ok to me, but what do you think? and do you know it? I just want to make sure I am suggesting the best option. It is softgel but from what I could understand it comes from bovine source. And about the daily intake, since fish oil contains naturally vitamin A and D3, but the quantity present is not enough to suppress the daily need, should I suggest to take 2 per day for a pregnant woman and for postpartum?<br>Here is the link: <a href="https://www.solgar.com/products/cod-liver-oil-softgels-vitamin-a-d-supplement/" rel="nofollow noopener" title="https://www.solgar.com/products/cod-liver-oil-softgels-vitamin-a-d-supplement/">https://www.solgar.com/prod...</a> <br>Thank you in advance</p>]]></message>

<message><![CDATA[<p>Hi Maria – it would be helpful to clarify with the manufacturer directly if the vitamin A in this formula is naturally occurring or not. The inclusion of 'retinyl palmitate' in its  ingredient list may communicate that synthetic vitamin A was added during its processing. Generally speaking, supplementing with synthetic vitamin A is not recommended during pregnancy, except in certain circumstances (i.e. plant-based clients). Furthermore, it remains unclear if the cod liver oil is sourced from wild cod. This would also be helpful to clarify with the manufacturer. In respect to dosage, it's difficult for us to provide guidance without better understanding a client’s dietary and supplemental intake. This would need to be individually assessed before considering dosage requirements.</p>]]></message>

<message><![CDATA[<p>Hi! I have one question and one comment.</p><p>If a mother experiences very little or no breast changes during pregnancy, is this an indicator that milk supply will be low?</p><p>Also, I have come across some very interesting information about frenectomies and fascia. From a mother who opted to have the procedure done on her children, I can attest that breastfeeding outcomes did not improve and I regret making the decision. (This of course is no judgement on those who choose to do so.) The more I have dug into tongue and lip tie releases, the more I have learned that a tight frenum is more correlated with tight fascia that can be released with bodywork first. I wish to share some resources for the Oh Baby Academy to review as they may be helpful and shed more light on the subject if that is ok.</p><p>Thanks!</p>]]></message>

<message><![CDATA[<p>Hi Jane ‒ we deeply appreciate your patience with our reply! It’s difficult to provide a definitive answer as regulations differ between countries and heavy metal concentrations can range vastly between whole food sources and harvest locations. While best to aim for lower consumption, many regulatory boards recommend limiting consumption of seaweed snacks to one serving daily for children, rather than strict avoidance altogether. This is something that we are monitoring closely and will be sure to share any new information that becomes available.</p>]]></message>

<message><![CDATA[<p>Hello,<br>I had a few questions on conducting my client trial. What are the best ways to navigate recommending the client change the prenatal the client is taking? In reviewing the important nutrients for the semester my client is in, and reviewing the prenatal, the forms found in the prenatal are not most optimal forms. I anticipate that for the duration of her pregnancy she has been taking the prenatal and I'm just wondering how to navigate my recommendation in such a way that does not create fear. In other words, I want to outline recommendations for a prenatal that offer the bioavailable forms, while also educating on the benefits of these nutrients. The client has not expressed any pregnancy related symptoms that would indicate any current problems with the prenatal. A few of the nutrients, such as vitamin c and b12 are not in the bioavailable form, but my client maintains a well balanced diet, so these areas I am not so concerned about. If I outline in our client trial when submitting a breakdown of specific nutrients of concern of why we don't feel they should continue taking the prenatal, is it also sufficient to back up my answer by saying though B12 and Vitamin C are not in their most bioavailable forms, they would receive an adequate intake from food?</p>]]></message>

If your client remains unopened to changing her prenatal multivitamin after gently explaining the importance of bioavailability and how it can support the development of mother and baby, emphasis around whole food sources would certainly be helpful!</p>]]></message>

<message><![CDATA[<p>Again, going through the recording, the girl talks about re-introducing fish after four/five days. Is this the recommendation for the high allergenic foods? I must have missed that :-/ so in the case of fish, you give fish one day and the wait four days until you give fish again? Is this for all babies or for babies that have presented a reaction? or for high risk babies? Thanks!!</p>]]></message>

<message><![CDATA[<p>Hello, <br>For my client trial I have a lady interested who is getting close to 12 months postpartum, her son has recently started refusing the breast and she is now pumping 3-4 times a day and has been doing so for about 3 weeks now. Would this be considered a postpartum condition? If not is this still considered breastfeeding? i.e. would she be better suited as my general nutrition client or my postpartum conditions client (provided another postpartum condition is identified)? <br>Thanks, Jayde :)</p>]]></message>

<message><![CDATA[<p>Hello! My client is taking an omega 3 supplement but the source is from Wild Alaskan Salmon Oil. From the Omega 3 module, the preferred source is from anchovies, sardines, squid or cod liver oil. I'm just looking for some feedback on this source. It is meeting the 1400 mg requirement as well as the minimum amount of DHA.<br>One other question I have is about the prenatal my client is taking. It is New Chapter Perfect Prenatal : <a href="https://www.newchapter.com/multivitamins/perfect-prenatal-multivitamin/" rel="nofollow noopener" title="https://www.newchapter.com/multivitamins/perfect-prenatal-multivitamin/">https://www.newchapter.com/...</a><br>It shows that it is from food sources and fermented for maximum absorption. But when I look at most of the forms of the nutrients, they aren't the bioavailable forms. I'm a bit confused on this. Is this just marketing? Based on what I see, I have concerns with this supplement.</p>]]></message>

Your volunteer client may satisfy the General Nutrition requirements as long as she is under 12-months postpartum and continuing to breastfeed / pump at the time of your consultation.

<message><![CDATA[<p>Hi Lindsey – wild salmon oil remains a preferred source of omega 3s and is included in our Supplement Database as a preferred option. In regards to the New Chapter Prenatal, we are currently awaiting clarification from the manufacturer directly. It is possible that nutrients, like folic acid and cyanocobalamin, are added separately and then fermented in a food base to increase its bioavailability and digestibility. However, we will let you know once the manufacturer responds to our enquiry.</p>]]></message>

I would really appreciate your advice in regards to whether or not to recommend supplements:</p><p>* With the information provided so far in the course, I feel supported with upgrading and providing advice on supplements my clients may already be taking, however, I feel completely underprepared to know if and what supplements to suggest  (i.e DHA, Vitamin D I understand how to choose the brand but am unsure how to identify if a client needs to supplement certain nutrients) when a client is not already taking anything without feeling like I am stabbing in the dark a little (and when the client is not in any stage of Motherhood).<br>* My Trial Client's primary health goals are ensuring she is consuming the the nutrients she needs (as well as managing anxiety so I will deal with caffeine intake, balancing meals, microbiome, food quality and blood sugar management) so I feel I <i>do</i> need to address supplementation. She is pescatarian but has hemochromatosis so I will not be recommending any iron supplements.<br>Please help!</p>]]></message>

<message><![CDATA[<p>Hi Elaina – such a juicy and controversial question! Unfortunately my designation of Registered Holistic Nutritionist restricts Oh Baby from advising on raw milk as it remains illegal in Canada. However, there are a few reasons why we do encourage full-fat dairy products in general. Healthy fats have an unparalleled ability to create long-lasting satiation at 9-calories per gram, in comparison to that of protein and carbohydrates which offer 4-calories per gram. Healthy fats are also critically important during the reproductive years, and we are still experiencing some residual fears around fats and weight gain for example. Generally speaking, when fat is removed from dairy products to reduce its caloric content, sugar and additional additives are added to heighten its flavor profile. This would be important to take into consideration when supporting clients with reading nutritional labels. While we do not promote pasteurized dairy, it would be beneficial to emphasize organic and grass-fed for client's who consume milk.</p>]]></message>

<message><![CDATA[<p>Hi team!</p><p>Question - there is a local brand of supplements here in Berlin that I love and recommend a lot (Sunday Natural) Their Vitamin D3 supplement also comes with Vitamin K2, which they advertise pretty strongly as being an important cofactor for proper Vitamin D absorption. I was wondering if this specific combination is something we should be recommending to pregnant or lactating women or is it best to address these vitamins separately? I know it's a strange one as the RA Vitamin D intake is a bit of a sliding scale itself, and then also not much known about proper K2 intake! Any thoughts on this?</p>]]></message>

<message><![CDATA[<p>Hi Anja – as a gentle reminder, our small team is unfortunately unable to support graduates through the discussion boards. However, we do highly encourage continued conversation through our Oh Baby Student Community on Facebook. The combination of vitamin D3 and K2 can be tremendously beneficial, though it is important to assess each client’s unique requirements. Supplementing with 2000 to 4000 IU of vitamin D3 has been proven safe for expectant mothers while a tolerable upper limit intake has unfortunately not yet been established for vitamin K2. As such, I would encourage no more than 200mcg of vitamin K2. Based on these considerations, the vitamin D3 (2500 IU) and K2 (100mcg) supplement from Sunday Natural may be supportive for certain client’s, depending on their unique requirements.</p>]]></message>

<message><![CDATA[<p>Excellent question! We generally recommend families proceed forth with the introduction of allergenic sources between the ages of 6 to 12-months. This helps their immune system develop tolerance and protect against an overactive response. While the introduction of allergenic sources is not focused on during the Food Sensitivities / Eczema Client Trial, it can be helpful to recommend that families introduce each allergenic source a minimum of two to three times, spaced 5-days apart.</p>]]></message>

He also had blood in his stool early on, which went away after she took eggs, dairy and soy out of her breastfeeding diet. His symptoms did improve then, and he was not on solids yet.</p><p>He started solids at 6 months.</p><p>His symptoms did not come back right away when she reintroduced the foods into her diet. His reflux just came back one week ago, 3 days after she gave him eggs for the first time. He had an allergic reaction to the egg as a solid food (rash on mouth and face within minutes of eating it). She is not sure if the reflux is related to the egg.</p><p>She has been instructed by his doctor to hold off giving him dairy and soy until after his nine month check-up.</p><p>I’m wondering if she’s a good candidate for this consultation. I won’t be able to help with the allergy but is it worth looking into whether the reflux is caused by other foods or do you think its related to the egg allergy?</p>]]></message>

While we agree that this mother and baby would certainly benefit from your guidance around gut support as a CNC in practice, they unfortunately would not meet the requirements outlined for this particular client trial volunteer.</p>]]></message>

<message><![CDATA[<p>Hi Susanna – thanks again for your patience! Lily Nichols has an excellent <a href="https://lilynicholsrdn.com/vitamin-d-pregnancy" rel="nofollow noopener" title="https://lilynicholsrdn.com/vitamin-d-pregnancy">article</a> on vitamin D metabolism that may be helpful to review.</p><p>In summary, once vitamin D is consumed through food, supplements, or sun exposure, the body converts this form into 25-hydroxy-vitamin D for circulation. As required, it will then be activated into its hormonally active form, calcitriol or 1,25 (OH)2D. This form is not routinely tested during pregnancy because the rate at which the body activates vitamin D is much too high. Calcitriol begins to rise immediately after conception, and is generally two to three times higher than baseline by 12-weeks gestation. This process is considered to be physiologically normal during pregnancy, and actually plays a pivotal role in placental function, insulin resistance, genetic expression, and possible protective benefits against disease.</p><p>With how critical vitamin D is during pregnancy, postpartum, and the growth and development of babies, we wholeheartedly believe in the maintenance of adequate levels. While food sources and safe sun exposure are ideal, it unfortunately is not the reality of many modern women. We know that a mother’s vitamin D status is indicative of their baby's, and with many mother's entering postpartum in a depleted state, additional supplementation can be tremendously beneficial.</p>]]></message>

<message><![CDATA[<p>Hello, could you please share what kind of evidence we have that runny purees are better than chunky ones? Here in Brazil the official recommendation from the health ministry is that we should never puree the food but always only mash it with a fork, so that there still is a difference in consistency. They say otherwise baby will not be able to develop chewing properly and it will increase selectivity, since they are only accustomed to one consistency. You write that chunky purees can lead to more gaging, but since gaging is a healthy reflex for the body to cope with food, is more gaging a problem? Thank you!</p>]]></message>

I have two potential clients and not sure if they meet the requirements for this assignment. Hoping you can help.</p><p>1. I have a mama with a 20 month old that has a suspected food sensitivity to tomato and fatty meats (sausage). It seems to cause reflux/heartburn in the middle of the night or break up a nap and she also had family liquid stools. She has taken these two foods out of her daughters diet and reintroduced them two weeks ago. Her daughter had the same reaction as before.</p><p>She also get’s a rash from hummus and cinnamon that appear within 10 of eating it.</p><p>The rash I suspect allergy but would her other symptoms be enough for this client trial?</p><p>2. A mama with a 6 month old that has eczema on his nose, eyelid, below eye and around mouth. He has been eating solids for a month.</p><p>Her doctor has verified that it is eczema and it seems to come and go.</p><p>So far she has given him a few allergenic foods: oatmeal, peanut butter, cashew butter, almond butter, banana, mango, avocado, strawberry, blueberry.</p>]]></message>

<message><![CDATA[<p>Hi Nadia, we deeply appreciate you checking-in with us! Based on the information provided, your first volunteer unfortunately would not meet the requirements for this client trial. Acidic and high-fat foods, like tomato and sausages respectively, are common culprits of heartburn. The timeline of reaction for hummus and cinnamon also unfortunately aligns with a food allergy which remains outside the eligibility requirements. In respect to your second volunteer, it's possible that contact dermatitis may be contributing to this reaction. However, can we first confirm how long it takes for the eczema to present following the consumption of these foods? For instance, is it noticeable upon consumption?</p>]]></message>

<message><![CDATA[<p>That is correct – we are currently reviewing a large volume of literature and guidelines to ensure that CNCs are providing supportive, evidence-based recommendations for these mothers. Our client trials are not established to support twin pregnancies; however, we are happy for you to proceed with supporting a singleton and referring your client to her primary healthcare provider for additional support. If this does not resonate, you may also consider another volunteer client that aligns better with the eligibility requirements.</p>]]></message>

<message><![CDATA[<p>Hello!<br>I'm sorry if this is asked too many times, but I just need to clarify with Vitamin A as there is so much confusion for me still. If a prenatal contains Vitamin A only from Retinyl Palminate even when it is under 770-3000mcg RAE or 2566-10,000IU is it still not recommended? My understanding from the supplement database is if it has the recommended amount of mcg or IU from beta carotene, or if it comes from beta carotene AND retinyl palminate, then it is good. But if the Vitamin A comes solely from Retinyl Palminate then it is not recommended?</p>]]></message>

<message><![CDATA[<p>While it’s generally advised to avoid ester forms of retinol during pregnancy, there are certain circumstances, such as strictly plant-based mothers, that would greatly benefit from a prenatal multivitamin with retinol palmitate as long as the cumulative supplementation remains under the tolerable upper intake limit established at 3000 mcg RAE or 10,000 IU. The ultimate concern with retinol is its teratogenic effects when consumed in excess.</p><p>I hope this helps to provide further clarification, but please do not hesitate to reach out if additional questions arise.

<message><![CDATA[<p>Hi Katinka – we deeply appreciate your patience with our response!</p><p>Upon the introduction of solids, spoon-fed babies will begin to suck purees off a spoon without chewing, similarly to how they “suck” back breast milk. Thus a mashed or chunkier consistency is more likely to trigger baby’s gag reflex, which in response to this, we have anecdotal experience and <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4796330/" rel="nofollow noopener" title="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4796330/">scientific research</a> that have shown parents become more reluctant to persevere with solid food introduction. This is ultimately the biggest concern with chunkier purees as ultimately we do emphasize the window of opportunity between 6 and 9-months where offering different flavors and textures is likely to have the biggest impact on a child’s eating preferences in the future. The hyperlinked academic article above also explores the literature available between textures and their respective impact on feeding preferences.</p>]]></message>

<message><![CDATA[<p>You are most welcome, Breann! As much as we wish there was a specific formula, this will require individual assessment of your client's cumulative vitamin A intake. Most prenatal multivitamins exclusively include beta-carotene. This is not necessarily a downfall as long as it is complemented by active vitamin A sources and/or is measured in ‘mcg RAE’. If the client consumes an optimal amount of active vitamin A sources, it would be beneficial to seek out a prenatal multivitamin with beta-carotene rather than both forms.</p>]]></message>

<message><![CDATA[<p>Ok this makes sense thank you!! My next question is, if a clients prenatal contains retinyl palminate and they rarely eat liver, butter, or eggs but are open to start regularly consuming, we should recommend they use a prenatal without retinyl palminate (beta carotene) but would this be a better option? Getting it from retinol sources of food instead of synthetic retinyl?<br>Also what are the recommendations around cod liver oil in pregnancy?</p>]]></message>

<message><![CDATA[<p>Cod liver oil can be a tremendously supportive recommendation; however, it is important to take into consideration vitamins A and D when assessing a client's overall nutrient intake. As always, we do recommend a food-first approach when possible. If a client's prenatal contains retinyl palmitate, it is important to ensure that the quantity remains under the upper tolerable intake level established at 3,000 mcg RAE, or 10,000 IU when recommending whole food sources. This is thought to be a conservative estimate for safety's sake.</p>]]></message>

<message><![CDATA[<p>Thanks for your response! This makes sense and I understand we always defer to the physician as well. For my own frame of reference, is there any concern that the child's digestive system may not be mature enough to handle introduction of an allergen this early? I know that we typically wait until 6 months to start solids for exactly that reason. You also mentioned that there has been demonstrated benefit from introducing allergenic foods between 4 and 6 months, however we recommend introducing nuts at 7+ months for instance. Can you clarify? Thanks so much!</p>]]></message>

<message><![CDATA[<p>Hello!<br>I have a number of questions about probiotics. I'm sorry, there's quite a few here!</p><p>I have come across a product called The Cultured Coconut (a traditionally fermented coconut milk kefir) which contains 4 trillion CFU/tablespoon. In examining the product and some information on their website it mentions that currently the most powerful manufactured probiotic supplement on the market contains 500 billion CFU with 4 strains. The Cultured Coconut had a lab conduct testing on their product which confirmed that there are 4 trillion + CFU and 40+ different types of probiotic strains in 1 tablespoon. Link below for strains:<br><a href="https://theculturedcoconut.com/pages/coconut-kefir-probiotic-strains" rel="nofollow noopener" title="https://theculturedcoconut.com/pages/coconut-kefir-probiotic-strains">https://theculturedcoconut....</a></p><p>1. My first question is I'm wondering if there would be a benefit to using this product instead of a probiotic in capsule or powder form or are there additional factors that one must consider? To me, it seems advantageous to have a variety of strains to give the gut a greater variety than what would typically be provided in a powdered or capsule probiotic but I'm not quite sure if there are other factors that we must consider that this product may not be able to offer in comparison to a capsule or powdered probiotic.<br>2. In the module, 30-80 billion CFU is the recommended amount for probiotics. This product contains 4 trillion +  in 1 TBSP. Is there any added benefit in supplementing about the 80 billion CFU/day or should this be avoided with our pregnancy clients? Is more not necessarily better?<br>3. Their website mentions that when supplementing with probiotics, people may need to rotate their probiotics to get a greater variety. Is this true or necessary? <br>5. If there is a client that is consuming food sources of fermented foods, is there any added additional benefit to have them also supplement with a probiotic if they do not have any of the conditions or symptoms in which we would typically recommend supplementation?<br>6. Would there be concern of the absorbability of this product in comparison to a powder/capsule probiotic? <br>7. What factors, if there are any, influence the absorbability of probiotics, food or supplement? <br>8. Is it best to take a probiotic supplement at a different time than other supplements? <br>9. Are there any vitamins and minerals we need to be aware of that would affect the absorption of those vitamins/minerals when taken alongside a probiotic? <br>Thank you in advance for your time!</p>]]></message>

<message><![CDATA[<p>Hello, I'm looking at the Needed prenatal supplement facts and for folate it says = (as L-Methylfolate, glucosamine salt, quatrefolic) and it says 918 mcg DFE (551 mcg folate). I'm a little confused by what this means. What's the difference between when it says mcg DFE vs just mcg vs just DFE? Also would this to be much especially if eating food sources as well?</p>]]></message>

<message><![CDATA[<p>Oh right, food sources are always recommended over supplements I knew that! haha. I just have one final question regarding measurements, what would be the difference between if it is listed as just mcg or mcg RAE, is mcg solely from retinyl palminate and if it lists mcg RAE that would mean it contains both sources? I just want to make sure I am reading and understanding all the different supplement fact labels</p>]]></message>

<message><![CDATA[<p>The 'mcg RAE' unit of measurement already accounts for the way different components in vitamin A (beta-carotene, alpha-carotene, beta-cryptoxanthin) convert into retinol at different rates, while beta-carotene measured in 'mcg' will require conversion that can be limited due to genetics and thyroid function. We delve into these topics during the lessons 'Considering Different Nutrient Types' and 'Nutrient Measurements' in Foundational Nutrition.</p>]]></message>

<message><![CDATA[<p>Absolutely! The current recommendation is that infants are exclusively breastfed (or formula fed) until 6-months of age. This is supported by the World Health Organization, the American Academy of Pediatric, the Australian National Health and Medical Research council, the UK Department of Health and National Health Service, Health Canada, along with Oh Baby. It takes time for baby's digestive system to mature and efficiently assimilate nutrients from solids. A premature introduction can increase the risk of gastrointestinal challenges like pain, discomfort, constipation, diarrhea, eczema, and sleeping issues. We also know that breastfeeding exclusively for the first six months is important for the nutrition, immunologic protection, growth, and development of infants and toddlers. In the case of high-risk infants, it is possible that their primary healthcare practitioner recommends an earlier introduction; however, this ultimately remains outside a CNC's scope of practice to advise on suspected or known food allergies.</p>]]></message>

Generally speaking, most practitioners will avoid answering this question as there unfortunately is no data to ensure safety of medicinal mushrooms for breastfeeding mothers. While this is sometimes okay with other herbs that have long standing traditional applications, people tend to be more cautious when recommending Lion’s Mane and Chaga.</p>]]></message>

<message><![CDATA[<p>When supplements contain nutrient forms outside of the curriculum, it is often best to consult the manufacturer directly for clarification. From our knowledge, Quatrefolic is a patented glucosamine salt of the preferred methylated folate form.</p><p>The FDA created the Dietary Folate Equivalent (DFE) measurement to facilitate consistency in measuring the quantity of folate across different food and supplement sources. This measurement unfortunately only compares folic acid to food sources of folate, as there has not yet been a formal or uniform conversion established for methylated folate. Whether the unit measurements is listed as “DFE” or “mcg DFE,” these terms are synonymous. When listed as ‘mcg’ only, however, it may require additional conversions included in the lesson entitled ‘The Role of B9’ in Module 1. Moreover, pre-existing regulations affirm that folate measured in micrograms can still be included on supplement labels to better support previous information shared with women of childbearing age. As the regulations and requirements can differ between countries and manufactured products, we highly recommend a conversation with the manufacturer if ever uncertain with the nutrient measurements. Hopefully with time we will see greater consistency with folate measurements and regulations!</p><p>Another important consideration is that dietary folate consumed from whole foods is not dangerous – it is an overconsumption of folic acid that we want to be mindful of. There is actually no daily upper limit of folate from whole foods (non-enriched) whereas the UL for folic acid has been established at 1000 mcg.</p>]]></message>

<message><![CDATA[<p>Hi Julianna ‒ it is the pasteurization process that destroys and deactivates the enzyme lactase, which renders dairy difficult to digest and potentially contribute to constipation. There unfortunately remains very limited research on the precise impact of pasteurized and raw forms on iron levels. The only <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0021925820652188" rel="nofollow noopener" title="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0021925820652188">study</a> that we are personally aware of found that rats developed anemia at the same rate in both the raw and pasteurized groups.

<message><![CDATA[<p>Hi Nadia – it's a bit difficult for us to provide guidance without better understanding baby’s health context overall (i.e. age, symptoms, severity of illness, and so forth). Generally speaking, we do not recommend restricting food as long as baby is meeting developmental readiness and is genuinely interested in consuming solids when under the weather. As stomach bugs typically resolve between 24 to 48-hours, with symptoms lasting up to 10-days, it may be helpful to delay the introduction of higher allergenic sources until baby is 100% well again. Continuing forth with formula will ensure that baby is properly hydrated and nourished during this time. If possible, it would be beneficial to emphasize the Pedialyte option without artificial dyes, flavoring, sweeteners, and preservatives. If this family is seeking an alternative to be discussed with their primary healthcare practitioner, coconut water would be a supportive option for additional electrolytes.</p>]]></message>

<message><![CDATA[<p>Hi Lindsey – excellent questions! There are contrasting opinions on the subject of absorption. Carley previously worked in supplement manufacturing and can personally attest to the variability in timing. Some believe that taking probiotics on an empty stomach is best so that beneficial bacteria move through the acidic environment of the stomach as quickly as possible. Others believe it is best to consume alongside food so the prebiotic content of the food can act as a food source for the probiotics in the digestive tract. The Oh Baby Team ultimately believes that consistency is the best approach with clients, so keep this in mind when making timing recommendations.</p><p>A variety of strains can certainly be beneficial as diversity is important when considering the health of the microbiome. Many strains are well-studied for specific benefits and the lacto-bifido predominant formulas are well-researched for their safety and generalized benefits.</p><p>Currently there is no tolerable upper intake level established for probiotics; however, the quantity of 4 trillion CFUs may lead to gastrointestinal disruptions and may not be the most supportive for those with digestive discomfort and/or are new to probiotics more generally. Tummy rumbles and bloating are to be expected when introducing a new strain or larger quantities (whether through food or supplementation) so it would be best to recommend a gradual increase.</p><p>Probiotic supplements are typically only required for those who do not consume sufficient dietary sources, have compromised digestion, tested GBS positive during pregnancy, history of yeast infection or antibiotic exposure. It is not meant long-term, but rather a 28-day protocol along with the encouragement of fermented foods for diversity and proliferation.</p><p>There is some research demonstrating that by taking a high quality probiotic, one can increase the other types of beneficial gut bacteria since these strains increase the overall health of the gut and help restore homeostasis. This indicates that there really is no need to rotate between different probiotics in order to get more diversity of beneficial flora. That being said, there is no downside to alternating probiotics if that’s what works for the client.</p><p>Some probiotics have been shown to improve micronutrient status; however, more research is ultimately needed to make conclusive insights. There are no antagonists to probiotics except perhaps antibiotics and herbal eradication agents which are contraindicated in pregnancy and while breastfeeding.</p>]]></message>

<message><![CDATA[<p>Hi Zandalee – Bobbie certainly looks like one of the better brands available! We deeply appreciate its emphasis on organic and pasture-raised sources; however, there are a few notable considerations. Like many other brands, it contains ferrous sulphate, which can be a contributing factor to constipation, nausea, heartburn, stomach pain, and black/tarry stool. This is something to keep in mind if baby is experiencing these symptoms. If utilizing this formula, it can also be beneficial to recommend a probiotic supplement to support the optimal functioning of baby’s digestive and immune health. Some parents may also prefer to explore soy-free formulas as well.</p>]]></message>

<message><![CDATA[<p>Hi I am a couple of questions:</p><p>- One of my volunteer clients (My eczema client) for my client trial has already undergone an elimination diet which didn't bring about any improvements. Here mum has stated that sometimes the eczema gets better almost overnight without changing anything. That it worsens when her immune system is low and since starting liposomal vitamin C she has seen a big improvement. I am wondering whether she has a histamine intolerance. I know I can't diagnose this but was curious as to what strains of probiotics she should avoid and what are ones she should be looking for in a probiotic. Is there anyway I could use this client or do I have to find another one?</p><p>- Second question is that another one of my potential clients divulged in the consultation that her baby had to be changed to a lactose intolerant formula. This consultation was a preparing to start solids, mother didn't indicate there was any suspected allergies on the intake form (said unknown). Her primary focus was choosing a feeding method and seeking knowledge on how to safely introduce allergens. When I questioned her about this she said the baby had experienced mucous in the stools for a  few days. Had been on the formula for a couple of months with no issues. Was tested for viruses that may cause that, which they found nothing and then told to swap to a lactose free formula. Mother mix fed due to weight concerns from the beginning, difficulty breastfeeding  (late diagnosis of tongue tie 4 months later). She wondered how she would go about reintroducing the original cows milk based formula. I specified that I would need to seek further guidance and only answered dquestions based on whata was appropriate for me to do so.</p>]]></message>

<message><![CDATA[<p>Hi there, one of my client is supplementing iron with Floradix.

<message><![CDATA[<p>Hi, I am a little confused about histamines. There is a section in the module that talks about salicylates, amines &amp; glutamines. Most searches on the internet come up as needed to avoid these compounds but Oh baby suggests they may be needed to address histamine intolerance. Also, should someone with a possible allergy avoid histamine rich foods / histamine releasing foods or is it encouraged to add these into their diet?<br>Would someone be able to expand on this information? Thank you so much</p>]]></message>

She is starting to introduce purees here and there but the 3 day food journal will be pretty bare as she is only introducing small amount as bubs is under 6 months. Would this client still be appropriate? Just wanted to make sure you don't require a full 3 day food journal for trial 1. Thanks heaps</p>]]></message>

<message><![CDATA[<p>Hi Carole, ferrous gluconate is an iron salt, as are ferrous sulfate and ferrous fumarate. These formulations commonly cause digestive discomfort and constipation and are not well absorbed with Floradix being slightly less effective than ferrous sulfate. We prefer iron chelates such as iron bisglycinate or animal-based heme iron because of their higher absorption rates and lower risk of stomach discomfort. This would be especially relevant for client’s requiring iron repletion as well.</p>]]></message>

<message><![CDATA[<p>Hi Morgan – included in the lesson entitled ‘Building and Diversifying the Microbiome’ are the probiotic strains known to lower histamine. Generally speaking, when an elimination protocol is followed without improvement of a client’s eczema, the wrong trigger has been eliminated. We delve into these next best steps during the lesson ‘Identifying Food Sensitivities Through an Elimination Diet’. While this baby is technically still eligible, it would be best that they consult with a naturopathic or functional medicine doctor to diagnose or rule out the possibility of histamine intolerance.</p><p>As food intolerances are the result of an absence of enzymes, rather than an immune response, the Gut Support Protocol would unfortunately not increase the likelihood of a successful reintroduction. However, unlike food sensitivities, food intolerances can be tested by a medical, functional, or naturopathic doctor and may be of benefit for this client as it ultimately remains unclear if the lactose-free formula was based on observations or clinical testing. In the case that baby is diagnosed with lactose intolerance (differentiated in the lesson 'Food Allergy vs Sensitivity vs Intolerance') baby may be able to tolerate small amounts of cow’s milk before experiencing gastrointestinal discomfort.</p>]]></message>

<message><![CDATA[<p>Hi Nadia – excellent question! As the recommended dosage for an adult is a single capsule daily, it would be appropriate to recommend ⅛ of a capsule for a 6-month-old with a single capsule lasting approximately 1-week long. This can be supplemented by dusting a mother’s nipple or finger into the capsule powder daily. If the capsule runs out quite fast, smaller dustings can be made the following week. Conversely, if there is an excess, larger quantities can be offered as well.</p><p>We also recently received notification that Seeking Health will be discontinuing their Probiota Immune supplement which may impact its accessibility. If searching for another prebiotic supplement, we would recommend sourcing the preferred forms of beta-glucans and galactooligossacharides, rather than inulin.</p>]]></message>

<message><![CDATA[<p>Hi Caitlin, there is some thinking taking hold right now that all polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA) are bad for thyroid health; however, this research largely comes from the work of one individual and is not represented in the larger body of research.</p><p>While omega 3 is a PUFA, the research available to us now shows that it is the imbalance between omega 3s and omega 6s that’s the issue, and that we need to increase omega 3s to bring this back into balance. Research also shows that inflammation compromises thyroid dysfunction – and that omega 3s help decrease inflammation to support thyroid function. Our team is continuing to monitor this research but, as always, welcome you to share additional literature for review if you come across contrasting findings.</p>]]></message>

<message><![CDATA[<p>Hi Elaina – the curriculum is in alignment with the research on salicylates, amines, and glutamines affirming that these may need to be removed in the case of stubborn cases of eczema. In regards to low-histamine dietary rhythms, there unfortunately remains very limited research on the precise impact it has on allergies. Generally speaking, histamine-releasing foods are only of concern when the top allergenic foods, along with other suspected triggers, have been tested without noticeable improvements. Ultimately it would be best for client’s to consult with their primary medical practitioners if concerned with histamine and allergies.</p>]]></message>

<message><![CDATA[<p>Hi there,</p><p>My client is taking Thorne Prenatal supplement. In terms of the Vitamin A content it is listed as 600mcg of Palmitate and 450mcg of Beta Carotene. I know the recommended amount of Vitamin A is 770mcg but I also know that the form of Beta Carotene must be converted to preformed vitamin A in the body... Therefore I am wondering if this isn't considered sufficient vitamin A and the client should consider additional supplementation? She is in the second trimester. In addition she is only taking 2 a day and the bottle is listing the amounts for 3 a day.</p><p>Thank you!</p>]]></message>

<message><![CDATA[<p>Vomiting and diarrhea in infant</p><p>Hi there. I have a client with a child who was sensitive to dairy in the mother's diet while she was breast feeding, but then seemed to tolerate it when it was introduced as part of solid food introductions. A few months later and the child has chronic ear infections and has been randomly vomiting and having diaper blow outs. This reaction is never immediately after eating, but usually a couple of hours(or more).  My first recommendation for this family would be to try removing dairy since this was previously an issue (and given the chronic ear infections), but I'm confusing myself a bit when I attempt to explain whether this is likely a sensitivity or an intolerance. My understanding from the curriculum is that a variety of symptoms can be attributed to allergies, sensitivities, and intolerances and that the key differentiator is the timing (i.e. does the child react hours or minutes after introduction). This makes sense for me when it comes to telling the difference between an allergy and a sensitivity, but what about when we're distinguishing between a sensitivity and an intolerance? Apologies if I'm just missing this in the materials, its a bit of a blur now that I'm revisiting this section after moving ahead to the trials. Thanks!</p>]]></message>

<message><![CDATA[<p>Hi, I'm wondering what the vitamin A content is in chicken liver, the food source chart doesn't list chicken liver specifically. Also, if a client's prenatal contains vitamin A measured in RAE and also eats liver once a week, and eggs and butter, are we to do the math to figure out how much IU's they are getting daily so they aren't going over? For example, 3 oz beef liver has 59,000 IU, which can be a whole weeks worth of your vitamin A not even including the amount that's in their supplement. Am I interpreting this incorrectly? I am just unsure how we are to know our client isn't getting too much vitamin A with their supplements measured in RAE as well as preformed vitamin A foods. Thanks :)</p>]]></message>

<message><![CDATA[<p>Hi Monica – it would be advantageous to recommend an increase in whole food sources to complement your client’s prenatal multivitamin. Generally speaking, additional supplementation would not be necessary unless your client is following a strict plant-based lifestyle, and if so, it may be best to explore an additional prenatal multivitamin that would better meet her individual requirements.</p>]]></message>

<message><![CDATA[<p>Hi, my client is taking the following Multi: <a href="https://www.burgerstein.ch/de-DE/produkte/burgerstein-schwangerschaft-stillzeit" rel="nofollow noopener" title="https://www.burgerstein.ch/de-DE/produkte/burgerstein-schwangerschaft-stillzeit">https://www.burgerstein.ch/...</a>. It contains synthetic Vit C. In the curriculum was Vit C from whole sources recommended and it says that synthetic Vit C is much less absorbable. Do you have any evidence to share about this? An article from the brand itself  <a href="https://www.burgerstein.at/at/de/ratgeber/ratgeber-von-n-z/vitamin-c-und-l-ascorbinsaeure-natuerlich-oder-synthetisch" rel="nofollow noopener" title="https://www.burgerstein.at/at/de/ratgeber/ratgeber-von-n-z/vitamin-c-und-l-ascorbinsaeure-natuerlich-oder-synthetisch">https://www.burgerstein.at/...</a>, talks about the topic and says "Vitamin C and L-ascorbic acid - natural or synthetic, There are no differences!" It further says: "Claims that you often see published on the Internet (“L-ascorbic acid is bad, only natural vitamin C is good”) are simply unscientific “fake news”. From a chemical point of view, ascorbic acid, i.e. vitamin C (from acerola extract or from eaten lemons, chili peppers, etc.) is exactly the same molecule as vitamin C produced synthetically (i.e. from glucose) and develops 100% the same physiological effect in the body. The molecule is exactly the same." Since the prenatal from  Burgerstein is a very common prescribed Prenatal Multi in Switzerland and a brand that I actually thought is trustworthy and reliable I would very much appreciate your thoughts about this. Thanks a lot!</p>]]></message>

<message><![CDATA[<p>Hi Savannah – thanks for checking with us! As it stands, 15-minutes would be much too long for your video submission. The reason we ask for it to be shorter is so that you can practice being concise with your pitch. There are a few strategies that may be helpful in condensing your video response overall. Firstly, you are not required to summarize the client health context but rather greet your client before delving into your thoughtful questions. Secondly, it can be beneficial to provide your questions and follow them up with a brief rationale before moving onto your recommendations.</p>]]></message>

<message><![CDATA[<p>The most important consideration here is that your client’s supplemental intake does not exceed the tolerable upper limit intake. This is thought to be a conservative estimate for safety’s sake, as studies have shown that a daily dose of 9000 mcg RAE (30,000 IU) have not contributed to birth defects, and this has been associated with synthetic forms and arctic animals.</p><p>In respect the chicken livers, the exact quantity may differ depending on its source; however, it will generally contain approximately 3000 IU per ounce. When recommending liver during pregnancy, it can be helpful to specify its frequency as well. For instance, moderate amounts of organic, grass-fed liver is often defined as 1 to 2-ounces per week. If your client is regularly consuming active vitamin A-rich sources, and expressed concern around vitamin A toxicity, it may be helpful to explore a prenatal multivitamin that contains a lower amount of beta-carotene, measured in 'mcg' specifically.</p>]]></message>

<message><![CDATA[<p>Hi Monica,<br>Feramax is a relatively new iron supplement utilizing something called a polydextrose-iron complex. While polysaccharide-iron is not new, this particular form utilizing polydextrose has not been on the market long. Because of the novelty of this particular supplement and the company’s patent on this particular form of iron, there is a not a lot of information about it available. Polydextrose is a form of soluble fiber manufactured in a lab. The company that makes Feramax says that polydextrose may increase the intestinal absorption of iron while decreasing gastrointestinal side effects; however, one research study indicates that there is limited bioavailability of this particular form compared to other forms of iron. A concern, with regard to Feramax, is like you said, there are multiple additives and artificial colorants. Hopefully, more research will be available on this particular form of iron in the future.</p>]]></message>

<message><![CDATA[<p>Thank you! So just to make sure I have this clear. If we see a child with some issues with dairy for example. We would first look at the timing - if the reaction is taking place  more than two hours after exposure we can be fairly certain it is not an allergy and is instead a sensitivity or intolerance. Then to determine whether it is an intolerance or a sensitivity we would look at symptoms. If the symptoms are primarily gastrointestinal then we would suspect intolerance, but would need to do testing to be confirm. Is that correct?</p>]]></message>

<message><![CDATA[<p>That is correct; however, gastrointestinal symptoms will not definitely  communicate lactose intolerance. That is why it is best to recommend additional testing prior to supporting clients with a suspected intolerance. Those with dairy sensitivities may also express symptoms like phlegm, clogged sinuses, constant sniffles, and/or eczema.</p>]]></message>

<message><![CDATA[<p>Hi Jemimah – thanks for your patience with our response! Intermittent fasting is not recommended during pregnancy or lactation, as there is not enough evidence to suggest that it would be beneficial during a time when micronutrient and caloric needs are at their highest. The precise timing can vary between individuals, along with food and beverage sources. For instance, proteins can be found in breast milk within 3 to 6-hours following consumption, while caffeine appears to peak in breastmilk around 60-minutes.</p>]]></message>

<message><![CDATA[<p>Excellent question! It is possible that baby is exhibiting a histamine reaction, due to the spotting around the mouth that you described. However, as the timing of the reaction is not indicative of a food sensitivity, it is best that client's presenting with this reaction consult their primary healthcare practitioner as consecutive introductions may worsen baby’s reaction.</p><p>It has been shown that two to three exposures, at minimum, will be effective in supporting baby’s tolerance to highly allergenic sources. Due to the incredibly effective and efficient nature of the Gut Support Protocol, a known or suspected trigger only requires elimination for a few months, at most, before it can be re-introduced and supportive of reducing baby’s overall risk before 12-months of age.</p>]]></message>

<message><![CDATA[<p>Erythritol is a sugar alcohol which can contribute to flatulence, diarrhea, and gastrointestinal upset in some individuals, though it does seems to affect less people. More research is ultimately needed to determine the safety profile of erythritol in pregnancy and breastfeeding but generally it is regarded as safe. Since erythritol is a non-nutritive sweetener, meaning it does not provide calories or nutrients, it is important that it does not replace other, more nourishing foods.</p><p>You can find a list of recommended sweeteners and sweeteners to avoid / find substitutions for in the Oh Baby Food Guide but in general it is preferred to stick with natural sweeteners or alternatives such as monk fruit or stevia. Also, we deeply appreciate you checking-in with us, Kayla! This is a supportive amount of enquiries, and if our replies take a little bit longer, know that we will address them as soon as we possibly can.</p>]]></message>

<message><![CDATA[<p>Hi Carole – thanks for your patience with our reply! While synthetic ascorbic acid and whole food of vitamin C are technically the same molecule, we prefer whole food vitamin C sources for their inclusion of phytonutrients, such as carotenoids, anthocyanins, and bioflavonoids, which offer additional health benefits. For example, research has suggested that vitamin C and bioflavonoids have a complementary effect, increasing their effectiveness when taken together. Synthetic vitamin C unfortunately does not provide these additional plant nutrients and is often sourced from GMO corn. While whole food vitamin C remains preferable, ascorbic acid is used in many supplements, even in high-quality formulations. Therefore, ascorbic acid in a multivitamin often isn’t enough on its own to recommend against the supplement altogether. In these situations, it can be helpful to contact the supplement manufacturer to inquire about sourcing. The Oh Baby Team is closely monitoring comparative studies between the two nutrient forms, as research remains very limited to date.</p>]]></message>

<message><![CDATA[<p>Hi Zandalee, adaptogens align more with supplements than foods. In regards to food/beverages to support your volunteer client, please go back through the curriculum keeping in mind that it’s not only important to consider which foods to add, but also which food/beverages to avoid depending on what the volunteer client is already consuming. Supporting stress through nutrition can be pretty straightforward, as most clients can make alterations to support lower cortisol, adrenal function, and so on with a little guidance.</p>]]></message>

<message><![CDATA[<p>Hi Mackenna, it’s difficult for us to provide guidance without better understanding your client’s nutritional requirements or supplementation protocol. As CNCs, we do recommend a food-first approach when possible. However, high-quality supplements can be especially beneficial for those in nutritionally demanding life stages, with known nutrient deficiencies, and so forth. It would be particularly helpful to review the lesson entitled ‘Supporting Clients with Supplements’ following your personal assessment of this client's health intake forms and food journal.</p>]]></message>

She isn't interested in soaking or sprouting and her prenatal I am recommending contains 15mg of zinc from a whole foods source. Due to the fact that she is mostly plant based I know the curriculum says to set your recommendation at 1.5x higher due to physic acid, fibre and anti-nutrients. So in this case would we recommend additional supplementation? Or does the 15mg in her prenatal still count as enough even on a mostly plant based diet?</p><p>Thank you!</p>]]></message>

<message><![CDATA[<p>No apologies necessary ‒ we're always happy to provide clarification! The 1.5x increase does not apply to supplementation, so if the client's prenatal multivitamin contains 15mg of zinc in a preferred form, it would satisfy her daily requirements regardless of her dietary preferences (i.e. omnivorous or plant-based). If the source contained in the prenatal formula is from a plant-based source, it would be helpful to confirm if it has undergone additional processing to increase its bioavailability (i.e. fermented source).</p>]]></message>

So it’s the MegaFood prenatal I am recommending and the zinc comes from rice amino acid chelate and no fermentation so I am assuming this would mean it’s not as bioavailable?

Each vitamin or mineral is paired with an ideal whole food using our unique process to deliver guaranteed potency and the benefit of health-promoting compounds present in the whole food itself.*” which is why I am a little confused on if additional supplementation is needed for her.</p>]]></message>

<message><![CDATA[<p>Thanks for providing us with the precise prenatal multivitamin, Monica! As mentioned in Foundational Nutrition, chelated minerals are intended to be more readily absorbed by the body ‒ acting as the "carrier" or "escort" of the compound. Most often, amino acids are used to chelate minerals because the body will readily recognize and absorb them. However, if wanting to confirm this, it can be helpful to contact the manufacturer directly.</p>]]></message>

<message><![CDATA[<p>Hi Nadia ‒ in an ideal world, it would be advantageous to introduce the top allergenic sources, like fish and cow’s milk, while empowering your client’s understanding of its importance and relevance. For instance, mindfully introducing these highly allergenic sources will help to inform their baby’s immune system to develop tolerance and protect against an overactive response later in child or adulthood. However, this may not align with the dietary preferences or beliefs of each family that you support. As such, additional consideration may be necessary to ensure baby is meeting their intake of essential nutrients.</p><p>In respect to combo-feeding, we highly encourage responsive feeding as this will promote baby’s capacity to self-regulate and establish a positive feeding experience that extends to long-term healthy habits. Once introduced to solids, baby’s caloric intake will naturally increase to meet their growing nutritional needs, and as their food intake naturally increases over time, breastmilk / formula consumption will gradually decrease and benefit from highly nutrient-dense foods.</p><p>When supporting families with breast milk alternatives, you may consider gently enquiring into a mother’s feeding experience and any additional questions / concerns. If the mother is content with the current formula, and does not express interest in receiving further guidance, emphasis should be placed on nourishing whole foods. As formula options differ vastly, it is important to individually assess if the formula contains essential nutrients of consideration. The lesson entitled ‘Supplementing a Baby’ in Module 2 can be tremendously beneficial when considering supplementation for general health purposes.</p><p>Whether baby is breastfed or formula-fed, nutrient requirements require re-consideration when milk intake decreases, or when baby weans. It’s recommended to take a food-first approach rather than jump to supplementation; however, special considerations need to be taken for vegan babies. A vegan baby in particular may be meeting their B12 requirements from the formula so that is something to consider as well as the status of the mother’s intake through supplementation for a baby being combo-fed. The RDA for B12 for a baby from 0 to 6-months is 0.4mcg, 0.5 mcg between 7 to 12-months, and 0.9mcg between 12-months and 3-years.</p><p>As for the baby with eczema, an omega 3 supplement is highly recommended for children with eczema regardless of whether they are formula-fed or breastfed ‒ following the dosage instructions on the supplement label. No additional EPA supplement is needed, and if successfully introduced to fatty fish and/or receiving complementary breastmilk, would be consuming additional EPA through these sources. If the contents of a specific formula remain unclear, it can be advantageous to contact the manufacturer directly for further insight.</p>]]></message>

<message><![CDATA[<p>Hi Janine, while it was previously theorized that potential allergens be delayed because of an “open gut”, the literature available to date has largely not supported this conclusion. Instead, the scientific data shows that gut permeability is greatly reduced in the first week of an infant’s life, and within one month, babies were shown to have “closed guts.” Additionally, the first foods recommended for BLW should be soft and easily digestible for baby as presented in the lesson “Finger Food Shape, Size &amp; Texture” in Module 1 of Baby Nutrition. The best feeding method will always be the one that intuitively resonates most with the parents.</p>]]></message>

Though the child is having multiple bowel movements in a day they are likely not complete bowel movements which is very common in constipated children. A helpful resource for yourself and clients may be the Bristol Stool Chart. This is a visual tool, which you can find through an online search, to help you identify levels of constipation or loose stools based on shape and texture.</p>]]></message>

<message><![CDATA[<p>Without better understanding baby’s overall health context, it is difficult for us to confirm the precise cause of eczema in this case. Generally speaking, when babies develop eczema before their introduction to solids, it is often indicative of a need for additional gut support and will likely worsen upon the introduction of more foods. If this client is being utilized for your Food Sensitivities / Eczema client trial, it is important to note that baby would unfortunately not satisfy the requirements if unable to follow the elimination protocol themselves. However, you can certainly proceed with supporting this client’s introduction of solids, if baby is between 4 to 6-months of age, with emphasis on gut support where applicable.</p>]]></message>

As we already know the culprit is dairy, we don't need to do an elimination diet, can I still use this as a food sensitivity case and just focus on gut support and walking through how to try dairy with the food ladder? Or do we need a client who doesn't know what the trigger foods are?</p>]]></message>

<message><![CDATA[<p>Thanks for checking with us, Janine! We hate to say this, but your volunteer would unfortunately not satisfy the requirements for the Food Sensitivities / Eczema client trial if unable to follow the elimination protocol beyond a change in formula or maternal elimination diet. However, you can certainly proceed with supporting this client’s introduction of solids, if baby is between 4 to 6-months of age, with emphasis on gut support where applicable.</p>]]></message>

Do you think is better to stop or to consume a smaller quantity, like 400DFE? I know that folate is more important in the 1st trimester, but I also think is important to continue. <br>Thank you in advance.</p>]]></message>

<message><![CDATA[<p>Hi again,<br>When we have babies that have been eating solids for a short period of time and are working through eczema elimination diet, do we advice parents to continue the introduction of allergenic foods? Or do we advice them to hold off while identifying the trigger food/foods? I'm wondering if they'll have enough time to introduce all the top allergenic foods before 12 months as the elimination diet and reintroduction can take many months.</p><p>Also if a baby has been given a few of the top allergenic foods right at the beginning of starting solids without any reaction, do we still advice the parent to go through the introduction timeline/process of these foods, offering three times with four day between each introduction?</p>]]></message>

<message><![CDATA[<p>Hi team,<br>When reviewing supplement recommendations and RDIs, how much would you allow for the clients diet? So with quantity and dosing, if a client regularly eats a food with that nutrient, do you lower the amount you would supplement? Or what if they only eat it every now and again? I guess my question is - do you dose according to the RDI, or allow for food intake too?</p>]]></message>

<message><![CDATA[<p>Hi Nadia, if the baby has been assessed to be low-risk in developing food allergies, it has been shown that two to three exposures, at minimum, will be effective in supporting baby’s tolerance to highly allergenic sources. Due to the incredibly effective and efficient nature of the Gut Support Protocol, a known or suspected trigger only requires elimination for a few months, at most, before it can be re-introduced and supportive of reducing baby’s overall risk before 12-months of age. If a higher allergenic source has been tested a few times successfully without a reaction, then it may be appropriate to include with mindfulness around any additional considerations (i.e. inflammatory foods). However, if the allergenic source has only been tested once, it would be highly beneficial to follow the introduction checklist, and ideally separate the introduction of multiple allergenic sources.</p>]]></message>

<message><![CDATA[<p>Hi Jess, the RDI takes into account both dietary intake and supplemental intake so you would want to adjust based on the client’s diet. Because a person is likely not eating the same thing everyday, their nutrient intake will change daily. Having several days worth of completed food journals as well as asking questions about the frequency of nutrient dense foods will help you determine a better overall picture of their intake. For most nutrients, keeping a steady amount through supplementation will be fine so long as the person is not approaching the tolerable upper limit intake for that nutrient when combined with their dietary intake. For instance, the tolerable upper limit intake for vitamin A has been established at 3000 mcg RAE or 10,000 IU. The <a href="https://ods.od.nih.gov/factsheets/list-all/" rel="nofollow noopener" title="https://ods.od.nih.gov/factsheets/list-all/">National Institutes of Health</a> provide resources for health professionals regarding specific nutrients and their ULs if interested.</p>]]></message>

If there are no appropriate food sources of the nutrient, please identify the ideal supplement source. This should include the ideal form of the nutrient specified and why it’s preferred. You may list a specific branded supplement containing that nutrient but it is not required. Hope that helps clarify things!</p>]]></message>
